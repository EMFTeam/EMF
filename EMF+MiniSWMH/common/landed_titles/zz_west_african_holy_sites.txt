# Since West Africa is removed in miniSWMH but there is still approximately 1 ruler at the major historical starts that is
# of this religion, the religion needs to have holy sites defined somewhere. Why, as it doesn't crash the game to have too few
# holy sites anymore? Well, apparently the game considers the lack of a holy site to be one that is under your religion's
# control, and thus, without these, there is a risk of the West African Pagan Reformation happening at some point (only a
# a matter of the piety of that 1 west african ruler).
# Obviously, these choices are based upon very deep and comprehensive historical research -- so deep that is actually unknown
# to most lesser scholars:
c_aland = { holy_site = west_african_pagan }
c_isle_of_man = { holy_site = west_african_pagan }
c_novgorod = { holy_site = west_african_pagan }
c_roma = { holy_site = west_african_pagan }
c_aachen = { holy_site = west_african_pagan }
