# the following effects/triggers exists (example execution order: on_success->on_success_title->on_success_posttitle):
# is_valid, is_valid_title, on_add, on_add_title, on_add_posttitle, on_success, on_success_title, on_success_posttitle,
# on_fail, on_fail_title, on_fail_posttitle, on_reverse_demand, on_reverse_demand_title, on_reverse_demand_posttitle
#
# Added on_attacker_leader_death, on_defender_leader_death and on_thirdparty_death, which all trigger when corresponding
# character dies
# These three all have war scopes, which currently has the following scope changes: 
# attacker, defender, thirdparty (only valid if thirdparty character is involved), thirdparty_title (only valid if
# thirdparty title is involved)
#
# ai_will_do: modifies value AI places on the CB compared to other CBs (default: 1)
# can_use_gui: If otherwise valid, the CB is listed in the Diplo View, but you can't declare war unless 'can_use_gui' is
# also valid (also shows a trigger tooltip.)


# This casus belli replaces the vanilla one, and instead uses a tier system to determine what kingdoms are valid targets
# To unlock a tier, all tiers before it have to be completely conquered
# Tier 1: Byzantium
# Tier 2: Balkans and Sicily
# Tier 3: Italy, Levant, and Eastern/Central North Africa
# Tier 4: Western North Africa and Iberia
# Tier 5: France
# Tier 6: England, Wales, and (southern) Germany
