THINGS YOU'LL WANT TO CHECK:

CB's:
	* I've only implemented our rebellion system for the faction revolts -- AND, by rebellion system, I mean the system that invites other vassals to join the rebellion, gives others the chance to give the lord their support, AND offers the chance for the lord to reward/punish the offenders afterwards. If you want that for the other rebellions (for the claim_on_liege, claim_on_liege_other AND both the pretender/independence factions) I can help with that OR you can do it yourself. Or leave it as-is. Up to you.

Factions:
	* In CK2Plus, the factions also affect a number of things in the other factions (with regards to their willingness to form/join), but I didn't add want to muck around with your existing factions' code. If you want to use these effects, you'll need to do a search in our factions file for the faction names to see what I've done. Might be a lot to look through -- I've done a LOT of tweaking to the faction AI.
	
CK2Plus_faction_decisions:
	* I put the faction maintenance decision in, but I understand you don't use annual "pulses" like we do, so you may want to put that onto Isis OR however you do your maintenance.
	
CK2Plus_faction_maintenance:
	* Just a note that the main maintenance event (PlusFaction.200) services as both the annual maintenance upkeep (there's a section which looks for the annual flag to be set, AND if it's NOT then that entire section is skipped) as well as the on-demand maintenance for calculating changes to faction opinions/moods as a result of things the liege does.
	* Annual maintenance starts at line 377, AND you'll want to go through AND make sure the effects line up with how HIP operates. For instance, we apply effects for Crown Authority, but I know HIP splits the effects of CA up into different laws -- so you might want some factions to like/dislike some of those rather than CA in general. You may also have more/different laws than we do. I did, however, already do the obligations laws.
		- in the Crown Authority section, HRE vassals feel more strongly about CA than anyone else. Up to you whether OR NOT to keep that.
		- You may want to add Centralization. CK2Plus doens't have it.
		- Years of Peace starts at line 1475 -- commented out the entire thing, as I'm NOT sure whether you have an equivalent system
		- I took out the Tradition faction's disapproval of decadence for Muslim realms a while ago (since we don't use the system) but I left the opinion modifier for it, in case you want to add that in
		
THINGS YOU'LL NEED TO ADD YOURSELF:

CB's:
	* The victor in a war is supposed to get a bonus to their Glory faction's opinion, AND the loser a malus. What I've done is added a glory_faction_loss_effect AND a glory_faction_victory_effect -- you'll want to go through your cb's AND add that to the on_success AND on_reverse_demand. Alternatively, I suppose you could add them into some kind of on_action event, but I like to have it visible in the tooltip for the player.
	
Events/Decisions:
	* There's supposed to be a plus/minus to faction approval based on the things factions like OR dislike. The court faction likes it when they get autonomy, AND dislike it when they lose it. They also like things that elevate vassals OR make them feel special. The glory faction likes things that grant prestige OR make the lord/realm look strong, AND dislike the opposite. The prosperity faction likes it when the realm gets wealthier, OR when republics get their way, AND dislikes it when there's chaos OR bad management. The tradition faction likes piety AND when religion/tradition is maintained, AND they dislike heresy AND rapid change. All those things are a judgement call, but in order to add the changes into individual events you'll need to do the following:
	
	To raise faction opinion, add this type of code:
	
		if = {
			limit = { any_vassal = { leads_faction = faction_court } }
			custom_tooltip = { text = COURTFACTIONMOODPLUS }
			hidden_tooltip = {
				random_vassal = { limit = { leads_faction = faction_court } set_variable = { which = "faction_mood_increase" value = 2 } }
			}
		}
	
		- replace "faction_court" with the appropriate action, of course
		- replace "COURTFACTIONMOODPLUS" with the appropriate faction name -- like "PROSPERITYFACTIONMOODPLUS", etc.
		- the # in the "faction_mood_increase" is the amount the faction members will get in opinion boost x5. The boost lasts three years.
	
	To lower faction opinion, add this type of code:
	
		if = {
			limit = { any_vassal = { leads_faction = faction_court } }
			custom_tooltip = { text = COURTFACTIONMOODMINUS }
			hidden_tooltip = {
				random_vassal = { limit = { leads_faction = faction_court } set_variable = { which = "faction_mood_decrease" value = 4 } }
			}
		}

		- same as above, but the faction decrease lasts six years rather than three (they remember slights longer).
