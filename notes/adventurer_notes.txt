NOTES:
------------------------------

WHEN PICKING A FRIENDLY COURT IN WHICH TO RESIDE UPON ADVENTURE ABANDONMENT:
# FUTURE: try to prefer lieges which the adventurer or folks in his entourage are owed a favor, are particularly
# friendly, or are powerful and can theoretically press any remaining claims for any of the adventurer or his court.

# FUTURE: add an `exiled` trait to these folks so that we can easily see an important piece of their history later as
# well as a TOM to the adventure target indicating exiled_from status so that we know to avoid them returning them
# home too easily and when to automatically remove `exiled` (perhaps replacing it with an `former_exile` trait)

# FUTURE: be more plausible about distance from current location as well as matching cultural or religious
# relations with new liege.

BETRAYAL-RELATED:
# FUTURE: consider allowing each courtier a relatively independent chance of escape from the betrayal/capture/ransom
# chain and not simply always moving ALL of them straight to the adventure target's court let alone the betrayer's
# prison. this adds a chance for some followers to escape, and should the adventurer be executed or die in prison
# and have inheritable claims, such escaped, exiled family may inherit those claims, allowing the quest to begin anew.

# FUTURE: betrayal of an adventurer should be considered a crime by all of his entourage (definitely, the betrayer
# which attempted their capture should indeed be `is_foe` afterward). yet more opportunties for coherent depth.

OTHER STUFF:
# FUTURE: remember to give an opinion modifier from the adventure target to all of the adventurer's followers which is
# at least crime = yes if not imprison_reason = yes, should they happen to end-up back in the reach of the adventure
# target (probably not just upon failed adventures but all the time-- these guys are all complicit traitors and
# should at least be regarded as `is_foe` by the adventure target for at least a bit longer than the duration of the
# adventure itself). exceptions would presumably be courtiers that were taken along for the ride as spouses,
# non-adult children, and non-adult grandchildren.  people that joined simply due to being fans of the adventurer
# or haters of the target, however-- they should be regarded appropriately, which will lead to rivalries, duels,
# usage of the rivalry CB, imprisonment, and executions-- appropriate & yet another layer of depth for this system.

- since adventurers have a proper court, would it make sense to instead use realm_diplomacy for most of the triggers which
  relate the diplomacy of the adventurer, currently, to various diplomatic outcomes?  after all, our abstraction of things
  like the province recruiting process implies that he does have help from his entourage and that he's being considered by
  other rulers from a distance.

- if an adventure target dies/abdicates but is succeeded by someone by that's still a valid adventure target, we should
  fix-up the adventure state so that the adventure simply continues (though they should probably quit any recruiting and
  relocate)

- as adventurers move from realm to realm, they should scan for unlanded, non-inheriting courtiers wherever they visit
  with which they might have common cause and use enough for them to join the court of the adventurer (up to some limit)
  -> likewise, if they are unmarried and a NAP which may lead to a worthwhile alliance can be gained from a potential
     marriage candidate in the court of their host, propose the marriage to their host.  arguably they may also marry
     for skill. forming alliances this way makes them more likely to succeed and is of course historical, although the
     likelihood of such a plausible match happening outside the target-realm is far, far lower than inside of it, so...

- consider spawning actual troops just a bit outside the border of [non-island] target realms instead of at the capital of
  an independent supporter, as the location is already arbitrary where all these adventure troops have been heading as the
  adventurer recruits from external realms, and this would probably greatly alleviate all of the issues with adventurers
  being easy to smash due to poor naval AI or poor landless AI as well as eliminate the need for spamming galley spawns
  in most cases

 - consider hacks to attach a troop composition to an adventurer title (rather than mercenary) using new Zeus features
   so that recruitment can actually be literal and reflect the types of soldiers that would be raised from the recruited
   provinces (based upon culture, primarily) w/o requiring the unit to actually exist raised on the map and wander all
   over the place. also allows the adventurer to upgrade his armies over time (e.g, light -> heavy) if more options are
   added for support (such as, instead of gold, access to weaponry and armor caches or training from marshals and such)

 - perhaps the adventurer should seek actual alliances from plausible external top lieges via the new Zeus `add_alliance`
   presumably he'd at least owe a favor to that liege for the temporary alliance (say, 5 years) if not, say, a large
   portion of the seized treasury of the target should he succeed (or de jure vassal transfers to that realm should he
   succeed... many possibilities there). doesn't require involuntary call-to-arms to remain, as we can call them into the
   war via event w/o any crazy state management.

MUST-DO:
- adjust claim CB completion to always cleanup adventure
- review all references to planning_claimant_adventure in Plus to catch the cases of which I haven't thought in which
  certain actions should be disabled for the adventurer or AI reasoning adjusted
- determine whether adventurers are considered valid by only_playable = yes rather than simply only_rulers = yes, and the
  same goes for only_independent = yes
- test, test, test!
