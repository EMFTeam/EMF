#   HOLY ORDER IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (aka HOIP, or Project Templar, or Athena) ;)   #
###################################################################################

[*] Create an emf_religion_formed_order_effect which:
    - ensures correct feudal government type
    - if RA isn't above 85%, applies religious_order_formed RA modifier to their religion

While applying the effect, generally audit all of the HOs for consistent expel/unexpel/borrow/repay
decisions/events & tooltip = { ... } that scripted effect in formation event options (effect should
hide feudal government setting & show whether a religious_order_formed RA modifier applies).

Apply the effect to and audit the following HOs[1]:

[ ] d_knights_templar
[ ] d_knights_hospitaler
[ ] d_teutonic_order
[ ] d_jomsvikings
[ ] d_hashshashin
[ ] d_bektashi
[ ] d_haruriyyah
[ ] d_holy_sepulchre
[ ] d_saint_anthony
[ ] d_immortals
[ ] d_zealots
[ ] d_sky_lords
[ ] d_spirit_guardians
[ ] d_warriors_perun
[ ] d_chosen_perkunas
[ ] d_sons_kaleva
[ ] d_huitzilopochtli
[ ] d_knights_santiago
[ ] d_knights_calatrava
[ ] d_saint_addai
[ ] d_zun_warriors
[ ] d_arsiyah
[ ] d_saqaliba
[ ] d_army_light
[ ] d_knights_saint_mark
[ ] d_saint_blaise

Added to list above:
[*] d_livonian_brothers_of_the_sword (SWMH)

[1] This list was taken from the emf_cb_unexpelled_holy_order_trigger. If there are more holy orders
out there, then I don't know about them yet [and they should be added to the trigger and given expel
decisions & so on if they don't have them already].

========== NOTES FROM AUDIT ===========

1. SWMH's livonian brothers of the sword is featureless and currently missing from the unexpelled holy
order trigger and the above list.  Might add standard events/decisions for it. Might not. Adding to
the above list for application of the new scripted effect, though.

HOs which have at least expel/unexpel decisions (and thus standardish events for people joining the
holy order & building castles & should be in the unexpelled holy order trigger):

[*] d_knights_templar
[*] d_knights_hospitaler
[?] d_teutonic_order
[?] d_jomsvikings
[?] d_hashshashin
[?] d_bektashi
[?] d_haruriyyah
[?] d_holy_sepulchre
[?] d_saint_anthony
[?] d_immortals
[?] d_zealots
[?] d_sky_lords
[?] d_spirit_guardians
[?] d_warriors_perun
[?] d_chosen_perkunas
[?] d_sons_kaleva
[?] d_huitzilopochtli
[?] d_knights_santiago
[?] d_knights_calatrava
[?] d_saint_addai
[?] d_zun_warriors
[?] d_arsiyah
[?] d_saqaliba
[?] d_army_light
[?] d_knights_saint_mark
