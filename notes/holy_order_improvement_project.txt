#   HOLY ORDER IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (aka HOIP, or Project Templar, or Athena) ;)   #
###################################################################################

[*] Create an on_new_holder event (created case) which:
    - ensures independent
    - ensures correct feudal government type
    - spawns 6 initial male soldier courtiers & 2 female courtiers
    - applies religious_order_formed RA modifier to their religion if RA < 75%
    - ensures they have at least 500 wealth (if less, clear it & then give them 500)

Generally audit all of the HOs for consistent formation/expel/unexpel/borrow/donate decisions/events & remove
any past partial work upon manually forcing feudal.

Audit the following HOs[1]:

[*] d_knights_templar
[*] d_knights_hospitaler
[*] d_teutonic_order
[*] d_jomsvikings
[*] d_hashshashin
[*] d_bektashi
[*] d_haruriyyah
[*] d_holy_sepulchre
[*] d_saint_anthony
[*] d_immortals
[*] d_zealots
[*] d_sky_lords
[*] d_spirit_guardians
[*] d_warriors_perun
[*] d_chosen_perkunas
[*] d_sons_kaleva
[*] d_huitzilopochtli
[*] d_knights_santiago
[*] d_knights_calatrava
[*] d_saint_addai
[*] d_zun_warriors
[*] d_arsiyah
[*] d_saqaliba
[*] d_army_light
[*] d_knights_saint_mark
[*] d_saint_blaise

Added to list above:
[*] d_livonian_brothers_of_the_sword (SWMH)
[*] d_army_lucifer

[1] This list was taken from the emf_cb_unexpelled_holy_order_trigger. If there are more holy orders
out there, then I don't know about them yet [and they should be added to the trigger and given expel
decisions & so on if they don't have them already].

File started on 2016-07-12.

========== NOTES FROM AUDIT ===========

=====>
SWMH's livonian brothers of the sword is featureless and currently missing from the unexpelled holy
order trigger and the above list.  Not adding features for it. Adding to the above list for
application of the new scripted effect & audit, though.

=====>
[*] d_saqaliba should be converted to be an ismaili HO and not shiite.
    [*] Events
    [*] Decisions
    [*] Title
    [*] Localisation
