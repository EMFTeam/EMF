#        PF CB VARIATION -- WAR LOCALISATION SHOULD DESCRIBE ACTUAL WAR           #
###################################################################################

Split PF cb_faction_overthrow_ruler into several CBs with more descriptive war localisation.

Goals / Facts:
- Specific faction demands should be shown in the WAR_NAME_* localisation
- Succession law change factions' CB variants will be slightly different
  ~ Instead of tracking the title upon which to change succession via title flags, use a CB type
    with proper support for thirdparty_title. Necessary to show the name of the title for which
    succession is to be changed in the war localisation.
- No need to differentiate which faction initiated the war -- just demands, type
- Use scripted effects and scripted triggers to minimize the amount of code duplication

New CBs:
[X] emf_faction_succ_seniority
[X] emf_faction_succ_primogeniture
[X] emf_faction_succ_gavelkind
[X] emf_faction_succ_feudal_elective
[X] emf_faction_overthrow_CA
[X] emf_faction_overthrow_TO
[X] emf_faction_overthrow_obligations[0]
[X] emf_faction_overthrow[1]
[X] emf_faction_succ_elective_gavelkind[2]
[X] emf_faction_succ_ultimogeniture[2]
[X] emf_faction_succ_tanistry[2]
[X] emf_faction_succ_turkish_succession[2]
[X] emf_faction_gender_succ_agnatic[2]
[X] emf_faction_gender_succ_cognatic[2]
[X] emf_faction_gender_succ_true_cognatic[2]

Notes:
[0] Will not differentiate the different types of obligations demands.
[1] This CB is for when the only primary goal of the war is deposition of the liege. Note that aside
    from having no demands in particular, this includes demands_surrender_title & demands_share_wealth.
[2] demands_revert_succession will use the emf_faction_succ_* and emf_faction_gender_succ_* CBs
    instead of current design. Hence, these are the extra succession revolt types.

Tasks (besides CBs):
[X] Scripted triggers & effects for the CBs centralized in emf_cb_faction_*
[ ] Convert all code which tracks succession law revolt state with title flags
[ ] Convert all code which checks for `using_cb = cb_faction_overthrow_ruler` into one big OR
[ ] Convert all war declaration code to choose the proper CB variant from the current demands
    [X] 4i faction wars
    [ ] Lower-CA faction wars
    [ ] Succession law faction wars

Localisation Needed:
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_SUCC_ELECTIVE_GAVELKIND
    "2nd English Civil War for Elective Gavelkind Succession in Ireland" [do show the thirdparty_title]
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_SUCC_FEUDAL_ELECTIVE
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_SUCC_GAVELKIND
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_SUCC_PRIMOGENITURE
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_SUCC_SENIORITY
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_SUCC_TANISTRY
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_SUCC_TURKISH_SUCCESSION
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_SUCC_ULTIMOGENITURE
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_GENDER_SUCC_AGNATIC
    "3rd French Civil War for Agnatic Succession" [always launched vs. primary_title, so don't show thirdparty_title]
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_GENDER_SUCC_COGNATIC
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_GENDER_SUCC_TRUE_COGNATIC
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_OVERTHROW
    "4th Byzantine Revolt to Overthrow Liege"
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_OVERTHROW_CA
    "5th Imperial Revolt to Overthrow Liege (Crown Authority)"
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_OVERTHROW_OBLIGATIONS
    "6th Spanish Revolt to Overthrow Liege (Obligations)"
[X] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_OVERTHROW_TO
    "7th Swedish Revolt to Overthrow Liege (Tribal Organization)"

Extra Tasks (arose during project):
[X] Add better county selection code for demands_surrender_title -- 1) try to select one not in the capital duchy
    isolated from other demesne provinces, 2) try to select one not in the capital duchy which borders provinces outside
    of demesne, 3) try to select one not in the capital duchy that is isolated from other demesne provinces, 4) try to
    select one not in the capital duchy that is isolated from subrealm, 5) ... etc.
[X] Add support for reverting succession law to elective gavelkind (no former_elective_gavelkind tracking existed)
