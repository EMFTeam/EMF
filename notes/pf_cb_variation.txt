#        PF CB VARIATION -- WAR LOCALISATION SHOULD DESCRIBE ACTUAL WAR           #
###################################################################################

Split PF cb_faction_overthrow_ruler into several CBs with more descriptive war localisation.

Goals / Facts:
- Specific faction demands should be shown in the WAR_NAME_* localisation
- Succession law change factions' CB variants will be slightly different
- No need to differentiate which faction initiated the war -- just demands, type
- Use scripted effects and scripted triggers to minimize the amount of code duplication

New CBs:
[ ] emf_faction_succ_seniority
[ ] emf_faction_succ_primogeniture
[ ] emf_faction_succ_gavelkind
[ ] emf_faction_succ_feudal_elective
[ ] emf_faction_overthrow_CA
[ ] emf_faction_overthrow_TO
[ ] emf_faction_overthrow_obligations
[ ] emf_faction_overthrow_revert_succession
[ ] emf_faction_overthrow

Other Tasks:
[ ] Scripted triggers & effects for the CBs centralized in emf_cb_faction_*
[ ] Convert all code which checks for `using_cb = cb_faction_overthrow_ruler` into one big OR
[ ] Convert all war declaration code to choose the proper CB variant from the current demands
    [ ] 4i faction wars
    [ ] Lower-CA faction wars
    [ ] Succession law faction wars
