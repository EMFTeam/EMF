#        PF CB VARIATION -- WAR LOCALISATION SHOULD DESCRIBE ACTUAL WAR           #
###################################################################################

Split PF cb_faction_overthrow_ruler into several CBs with more descriptive war localisation.

Goals / Facts:
- Specific faction demands should be shown in the WAR_NAME_* localisation
- Succession law change factions' CB variants will be slightly different
  ~ Instead of tracking the title upon which to change succession via title flags, use a CB type
    with proper support for thirdparty_title. Necessary to show the name of the title for which
    succession is to be changed in the war localisation.
- No need to differentiate which faction initiated the war -- just demands, type
- Use scripted effects and scripted triggers to minimize the amount of code duplication

New CBs:
[ ] emf_faction_succ_seniority
[ ] emf_faction_succ_primogeniture
[ ] emf_faction_succ_gavelkind
[ ] emf_faction_succ_feudal_elective
[ ] emf_faction_overthrow_CA
[ ] emf_faction_overthrow_TO
[ ] emf_faction_overthrow_obligations[0]
[ ] emf_faction_overthrow[1]
[ ] emf_faction_succ_elective_gavelkind[2]
[ ] emf_faction_succ_ultimogeniture[2]
[ ] emf_faction_succ_tanistry[2]
[ ] emf_faction_succ_turkish_succession[2]

[0] Will not differentiate the different type of obligations demands
[1] This CB is for when the only goal of the war is deposition of the liege.
[2] The 'Revert Succession Law' demand will use the emf_faction_succ_* CBs instead of current design. Hence, the extra types.

Other Tasks:
[ ] Scripted triggers & effects for the CBs centralized in emf_cb_faction_*
[ ] Convert all code which checks for `using_cb = cb_faction_overthrow_ruler` into one big OR
[ ] Convert all war declaration code to choose the proper CB variant from the current demands
    [ ] 4i faction wars
    [ ] Lower-CA faction wars
    [ ] Succession law faction wars

Localisation Needed:
[ ] WAR_NAME_EMF_FACTION_SUCC_SENIORITY
