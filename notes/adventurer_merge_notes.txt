changes made to the `adventurer` branch before merging into `alpha`:
- fixed a mismatch between how long the `do_not_disturb` timer was set in `emf_travel_to_ruler_effect` and the actual scheduled event delay
  -> the longer trips did not set the timer long enough, so the adventurer would end-up being detected as "idle," sent somewhere else, and then later also appear where they were originally scheduled to travel.
