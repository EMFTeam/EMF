Liege Levies & Taxes:
	Opinion Scale of Liege Levy Contributions:
		Minimum vassal opinion at which you'll receive their minimum required liege levy contribution (i.e., the "Min. Levy" modifier, which is 0% by default, but various means exist to increase it) is now -75 (from 0).
		Maximum vassal opinion at which you'll receive their highest possible liege levy contribution is now 75 (from 100).
		This shift in the relevant vassal opinion range reflects a move toward making feudals behave as if they have a more binding vassal contract than less advanced government types.
			If a vassal dislikes their liege slightly (e.g., -10 opinion), this no longer means that the vassal will not provide any levy contribution at all (not even the otherwise required min. levy contribution!); instead, they need to truly hate you (i.e., less than -75 opinion) in order to defy the feudal contract.
				Consequently, the minimum liege levy ("Min. Levy") modifier is now far more powerful than previously! Now, if your total min. levy modifier is relatively high, you'll be able to squeeze ample troops from vassals that otherwise would've given you absolutely nothing.
					This is important to understand, as it is the motivation for a number of changes to add more historically-motivated ways to control your min. levy (i.e., more authority / centralization / bureaucracy should lead to a higher min. levy modifier, as it reflects better enforcement and respect for the vassal contract, the general rise of legalism, the shrinking role of the lesser nobility in affairs of state, and the transition to a more organized and standing military).
			A perfect vassal opinion is no longer required to garner the maximum levy contribution -- a vassal with 75 opinion will provide just as much troops as one with 100 opinion now.
			As a bonus, this may also help level the playing field for the AI on military size, as it is well-known that players are far better at maximizing vassal opinion in ways that we cannot teach the AI, but we *can* teach the AI to be more effective at passing laws which affect the min. levy, and the new opinion scale is more forgiving of their hard-coded weaknesses.
	Comprehensive Balancing of Minimum Levy and Maximum Levy Modifiers:
		Throughout all of EMF, we've been working to rebalance the usage of all of the modifiers that control the minimum required liege levy contribution from vassals ("Min. Levy") and the maximum possible liege levy contribution from vassals ("Max. Levy"). Max. levy is scaled by opinion, and min. levy is a fixed, required percentage of a vassal's troops. The game calculates your liege levy from a given vassal from whichever of the two yields the largest troop count.
		Our aim has been to create enough "headroom" for almost all combinations of the game's maluses and bonuses to both modifier types in order to ensure that they have an effect.
			CK2's liege levy modifiers' only have an effect within their hard-capped range. Otherwise, magic troops -- or negative troops -- would enter the equation. This makes these modifiers unlike essentially any other modifier in the game (an exception: vassal tax modifiers, for the same reason but with gold instead of soldiers).
			If the sum total of such a modifier's value exceeds these limits in either direction, the "leftover" modifier amount has absolutely no effect. Without very comprehensive care in the design of their use throughout the entire game, this can easily lead to unexpected situations wherein bonuses aren't working as advertised or wherein you can "bottom out" due to too many stacking maluses.
	Obligations & Focus Laws:
		This set of law groups, two for each vassal government group (and a variant for Iqta instead of Feudal if the liege is Muslim, which has higher tax efficiency and different default settings), has been rebalanced significantly.
		Now also allow you to affect the minimum liege levy contribution ("Min. Levy") in a rather significant way.
			Each law step beyond *Minimal Obligations* adds +5% min. levies (up to +20%), while the Focus law slider ranges from +5% to -5% min. levies.
		Has a slightly smaller maximum range of possible liege levy modifiers with any given combination of Focus and Obligations law settings, as part of our rebalancing of liege levy modifiers throughout EMF.
		Modifier formulae for the law groups are now more intuitive:
			If increasing Obligations, you're always adding a positive amount to the min. or max. levy modifier rather than, at some tiers, just subtracting less.
			With the Focus sliders, tax trade-offs are now properly symmetric about the midpoint law, *Balanced Focus*, just as the levy trade-offs always have been.
			Opinion effect at *Minimal Obligations* is now 0, and for each additional increase in law tier, the malus grows by -5 (a total of -20 at *Harsh Obligations*).
		AI is more intelligent about passing these laws. Previously, the AI never tried to pass an Obligations law setting past the 2nd tier, and they would flip between the 1st and 2nd tiers based strictly upon whether they were *Greedy* or *Charitable*. Now, the AI will strive to maximize Obligations whenever relevant, but their personality is still a soft factor.
	Liege levies will now reinforce as fast as demesne levies (triple the prior rate).
