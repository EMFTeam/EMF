what Delnar has done or will do:
- minor titles
  -> where is (fe)?male_can_hold_minor_title_trigger? is it new & ours or new & theirs? do we need to adapt it?
- religion icons
- event modifiers & icons
- job titles
  -> make sure opinion_resigned_from_council not also being set by emf_council_lose (effect)
- game rules
- death reasons
- council positions
- combat tactics
- buildings? all at this point?
- cultures
- retinues

things to watch out for:
- succ_byzantine_elective being used as a trigger to imply 'imperial government'
- succ_feudal_elective and succ_hre_elective seem interchangeable for the purposes of most logic
- emf_feminist_religion vs. dynamic religion features/doctrines such as matriarchal, patriarchal, and equal
- AI will auto-set some CA sub-laws which it shouldn't (i.e., it doesn't check for is_law_potential IIRC)
- we need to test our 'Protected Inheritance' crown authority sub-law (enabled by High CA) to see if it applies to the de jure crown law title upon which it was passed or to the entire realm or not at all
- ze_administration vs. administration; revoke_title_law vs. revokation/ze_revokation; out_of_realm_inheritance_law vs. inheritance
- we need to sweep all new vanilla files for references to the defunct law succession_voting_power & handle appropriately
- audit all `add_law = succ_feudal_elective` for the HRE and likewise w/ primogeniture for the ERE, incl. CBs, as they need to use the title-specific laws
- the core PF triggers & effects need to be updated to use the new succ. laws as well as properly support the full range of gender succession variants (enatic, enatic-cognatic, etc.)
---> [ ] add tracking for: former_cognatic_succession, former_true_cognatic_succession, former_enatic_cognatic_succession, former_enatic_succession
- audit all refs to 'roman_imperial_government'
- search for whatever fires crusades at k_thrace and adapt to SWMH
- eventually, we should look at what impacts the 4-interest factions & their membership should have upon elective succession
  scoring

- in succession_voting, we'll need to ensure that our original coronation and sainthood systems' traits are reflected alongside those that PDX has added for catholics in HF

- go back to succ voting for hre_elective & address the elector title qualification problems (i.e., the generic conditions regarding de jure vassal titles, not the specific prince-elector title stuff)

[ ] ensure that `uncrowned` is applied to all coronation-viable rulers upon death, not just the Furry ones

[ ] ensure that government_flavor has been compatched

all-files (EMF + base game) pass upon `set_defacto_(liege|vassal)` [add `emf_liege_change = yes`]

all-files (EMF + base game) pass upon `gain_settlements_under_title` / `(vassalize|subjugate)_or_take_under_title(_destroy_duchies)?` [add `pf_liege_change_under_title_(begin|end)_effect = yes`]

all-files (EMF + base game) pass upon `out_of_realm_inheritance_law` [replace w/ `inheritance_[0-2]`]

all-files (EMF + base game) pass upon `revoke_title_law` [replace w/ `revokation_[0-2]` (non-Zeus CA law) and `ze_revokation_[0-2]` (Zeus)]

all-files (EMF + base game) pass upon `abdicate` / `abdicate_to` [replace with `emf_abdicate = yes` and proper event target setup for the `abdicate_to` case]

all-files (EMF + base game) pass upon `(feudal|late_feudal|imperial)_administration` [replace with `administration_[0-2]`]


~==========~

- test whether `recalc_succession` command will now actually do an immediate recalculation of the line of succession for
elective-style titles (i.e., if we can know the new top-scoring heir/etc. after changing to an elective-style succ. law, we
can run all of those laws through the dynamic reaction event chains & have far greater dynamism & realism in impact than
currently possible).


~==========~

he thinks crowned_by_pope is using the strong_basileus icon.
vanilla coronation trait tooltips properly show names of coronator. ours don't.
creating k_bohemia cost 1250 prestige
creating second duchy cost some weird amount of prestige
[bug?] byzzie has no coronation trait at all


~==========~

- jihads unlocked essentially at game start (MTTH) for some reason on EMF+V/1066: dang said something about the 'non-muslims controlling territory in the jerusalem area' trigger probably being at fault, but I don't know exactly why he said that beyond the basic face of it.
  + no actual jihad was *declared* right away, but the unlock event did happen.
  + was a jihad eventually declared?
- (again EMF+V/1066) the 2-3 catholic holy orders which normally unlock when catholic crusades unlock never unlocked, not even after a catholic crusade was successful
  + are they unlocking w/ HF/3.0 with the crusade unlock event in vanilla now? maybe they changed the behavior.
- we need to make sure the 'become a saint' and 'become a paragon of virtue' ambitions aren't overlapping in EMF
