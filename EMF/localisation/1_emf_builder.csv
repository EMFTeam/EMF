EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1402;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has asked for an audience with you: 'My [Root.GetLordLady], a vision of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] came to me and commanded I build a temple in [temple_province.GetName]. I will need your help, however, for I'm uncertain I can complete this grand project on my own.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_holdings_1402;Take this, and my blessing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_holdings_1402;I shall appeal to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful on your behalf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_holdings_1402;The lords and ladies of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] will all help you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_holdings_1402;I can spare you nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_emf_holdings_1402;I fear I can be of no help to you, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1406;With the death of [From.GetTitledFirstName], so dies [From.GetHerHis] dream of building a new [From.Religion.GetName] temple in [temple_province.GetName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1408_religion;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nWould that I could continue construction of the new temple in [temple_province.GetName], but seeing as I am not longer of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful, I suspect that would not be advisable. If you can find another to take my place, I recommend that you do so.\n\nWith great respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1408_culture;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nWould that I could continue construction of the new temple in [temple_province.GetName], but seeing as I am not longer [Root.Culture.GetName], I suspect that would not be in either of our interests. If you can find another to take my place, I recommend that you do so.\n\nWith great respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1408_ruler;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nWould that I could continue construction of the new temple in [temple_province.GetName] as planned, but my duties in the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] take me away from such matters. If you can find another to take my place, I recommend that you do so.\n\nWith great respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1408_incapable;While the construction of the new temple in [temple_province.GetName] has been ongoing, it seems that [From.GetTitledFirstName] is no longer in any condition to continue it. Many fear that unless [From.GetSheHe] miraculously recovers [From.GetHerHis] mind or someone else is found to take [From.GetHerHis] place, the project will never finish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1408_prison;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s imprisonment has halted all construction of the new temple in [temple_province.GetName]. The people are quickly scattering to the winds, returning to their homes...unless someone appears to take [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s place, all hope of it finishing will be lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1412;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nWould that I had better news to give you. I fear the site where I'd hoped to erect the [Root.Religion.GetName] temple is no longer suitable. Unless somewhere else can be found, I  shall have to abandon my quest in disgrace.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_holdings_1412;I have just the place in mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_holdings_1412;Sadly, there is nothing that can be done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1414;With no-one to urge the locals to continue working, the temple construction in [From.GetName] has been halted. Unless someone can be found to resume the task, it will have to be abandoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_holdings_1414;Someone will be found to continue construction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_holdings_1420;Pay for it myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_holdings_1420;Ask my liege for help;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1421;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nConstruction efforts on the new [Root.Religion.GetName] temple in [temple_province.GetName] have encountered unforeseen difficulties, and I fear I am completely without resources to continue. I beg you for coin, and I swear by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] it will be put to good use.\n\nYour humble servant,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_holdings_1421;Of course I will help [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_holdings_1421;I can offer [From.GetHerHim] nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1426;Good news! [From.GetFirstName] has completed work on the new [From.Religion.GetName] temple, assuming [From.GetHerHis] place as its [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]. All of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] rejoices, and a week of celebration has been called for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_holdings_1430;New City Construction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1430;It has taken years, but finally you have located a suitable site in [Root.Location.GetName] which is both defensible as well as suitable for merchants and tribal leaders alike to gather in a city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_holdings_1430;I should tell [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1431;Your [Root.GetTreasurerName], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], has discovered a site in [new_city_location.GetName] suitable for building a new city, a place which both merchants and [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] leaders believe could support a large number of your people. It will, however, require a fair investment of both time and effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_holdings_1431;My coffers will fund this project;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_holdings_1431;Everyone in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] will participate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_holdings_1431;We cannot afford such an indulgence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1433;The war raging in [Root.GetName] has ruined the construction that was underway for the new city. The effort will need to be restarted from scratch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1434;There is an issue with the city construction currently underway in [Root.GetName]: a fire destroyed a number of buildings after an accident, and there is a rumor amongst the workers that the site is haunted. It will take considerable convincing to get work to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_holdings_1434;Additional coin will convince them, I'm certain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_holdings_1434;They will continue because the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] tells them to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_holdings_1434;Then we must abandon the project;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1435;It seems several of your overseers have pushed the workers too far. There have been several riots in [Root.GetName], and while construction has not been delayed yet it certainly may come to that if the riots spread further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_holdings_1435;We will need to keep an eye on things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1436_tribal;A dispute has arisen with merchants in [Root.GetName], many of whom are unaccustomed to the idea of setting up in buildings as we are asking them to. They prefer their traditional methods, they say. Unless we get the merchants on board with the new city, it will never be completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_holdings_1436;I will negotiate with these merchants myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_holdings_1436;Send [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to negotiate with them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_holdings_1436;Round up a few and execute them, to show them their place;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_holdings_1436;They are holding out for more coin, I suspect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_emf_holdings_1436;We have no choice but to abandon the project;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_holdings_1437;After years of effort, the new city in [Root.GetName] is finally complete!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
