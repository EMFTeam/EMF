emf_decline_elective_empire;Decline Empire Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_decline_elective_empire_desc;Sometimes, one doesn't want to be Emperor. This decision allows you to waive any right to the inheritance of a feudal elective empire within the lifetime of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].\n\n§MNOTE:§! Even after waiving the election, it's still possible to appear the heir to such an empire, but this doesn't matter. The second in the line of succession will actually inherit upon succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#### EVENTS ####
emf_empires.0.desc;These are dark times. It is true, and I weep for the realm for its truth: the Empire has been broken. I can no longer foolishly claim the title. To do so would be comedy at best and sacrilege at worst...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_empires.0.opt.a;It's time for a change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#### MODIFIERS ####
emf_decline_elective_empire_modifier;Declined Empire Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_decline_elective_empire_modifier_desc;Since [Root.GetBestName] has no interest in becoming the Emperor, [Root.GetSubjectPronoun] waived [Root.GetPossPronoun] right to inherit an elective empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#### TOOLTIPS ####
WILL_NOT_INHERIT_ANY_ELECTIVE_EMPIRE;Once §Y[Root.GetBestName]§! takes this decision, [Root.GetSubjectPronoun] will waive all rights to inherit any feudal elective empire for the rest of [Root.GetPossPronoun] life. This action cannot be canceled during the lifetime of any given ruler.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
