EVTOPTA450;I don't mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB450;Avoid [Root.Liege.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC451;[From.GetSheHeCap]'s not my type;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA452;What took [From.GetHerHim] so long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB452;Dissuade [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD452;Kick [From.GetHerHim] out and tell everyone what happened!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC453;I went to [From.GetFirstName]'s chamber and gave [From.GetHerHim] a good tumble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC454;[From.GetFirstName] has spurned my subtle advances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA454;How could [From.GetSheHe] resist my charms?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC455;[From.GetFirstName] was furious and made a public spectacle of the incident!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA455;Oops. How embarrassing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_11;Even though you have been trying to conceive a child with your husband, it simply hasn't happened... and you are beginning to suspect you might be barren. Some of the maids have whispered that there are things which can be done to remedy this, although they are not entirely without risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_marriage_11;I don't care about the risk! I want a child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_marriage_11;I accept whatever [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] has in store for me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_marriage_11;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] will get no child from me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_12;There is a flurry of activity around [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s chambers one evening, and you are startled to learn that she has suffered some sort of injury. You can get little from [From.GetFirstName]'s tight-lipped maids, but suspect this might be a result of her increasing concern at having borne you no children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_marriage_12;Well, she certainly won't if she's dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_15;Your council has grown increasingly concerned at the fact that [barren_wife.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] still has provided you no children, despite the two of you being healthy and able. At first you waved away their concerns...but perhaps they are right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_marriage_15;I will ask my physician to investigate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_marriage_15;I will ask my [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] to investigate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_marriage_15;If that is [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s will, then so shall it be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_16;It has been years since [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [barren_wife.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] were married, and yet [barren_wife.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] still has not produced a child. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has asked you to look into the matter, as quietly as you can, just in case it's a problem you might be able to solve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_marriage_16;I will begin at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_17;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] visits your chambers one evening and informs you that [FromFrom.GetTitledNameNoRegnal] has asked [From.GetHerHim] to perform some...tests. It seems [FromFrom.GetTitledNameNoRegnal] is concerned at the fact you have yet to provide him a child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_18;After performing several tests upon [barren_wife.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], you are startled to discover that it is actually [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] who is responsible for the lack of children. It seems that, for whatever reason, he simply cannot have any.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_marriage_18;This will make for an awkward conversation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_19_wife;After all those unpleasant tests, all those strange potions and the poking and prodding...after all that, it turns out the real culprit for your lack of children is none other than your husband. He cannot have children. While saddened at the outcome, you also can't help but feel mildly outraged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_19_husband;After so many days of tests upon poor [barren_wife.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] comes to you and performs another series of examinations...and then informs you that you are the culprit behind the infertility, not her. It appears that, for whatever reason, you cannot have children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_marriage_19;My husband and I shall have words;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_marriage_19;That...was unexpected news;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_20;After performing several long and sometimes arduous tests upon [barren_wife.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s worst fears are realized: his wife is barren. Now it's just a matter of informing the unfortunate couple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_21_wife;After all those unpleasant tests, all those strange potions and the poking and prodding...after all that, it turns out my husband's worst fears have been confirmed. My womb is barren. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] delivered the bad news to me this morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_21_husband;After so many days of tests upon poor [barren_wife.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] came to you this morning to confirm your worst fears: she is indeed barren and will not ever bear you a child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_marriage_21;I think I knew this, somehow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_marriage_21;That is unfortunate news;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_22;After performing several long and sometimes arduous tests upon [barren_wife.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], you come to the conclusion that nothing is amiss - not physically, anyhow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_marriage_22;The news could have been far worse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_23_wife;After all those unpleasant tests, all those strange potions and the poking and prodding...after all that, it turns out my husband's worst fears are for nothing. We are both fine and fully able to have children, according to [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. It will just take time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_23_husband;After so many days of tests upon poor [barren_wife.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] came to you this morning to say there is nothing wrong with her - or with you, for that matter. [From.GetSheHeCap] gives you a potion to invigorate your loins and says it will simply take time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_marriage_23;All that for nothing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_marriage_23;Let's hope the potion works!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_25;You're uncertain where the rumors started, but they have, and the whispers all claim the same thing: that you cannot have children. What's more, you suspect the rumors are correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_marriage_25;Alas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_26;The whispers about [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s lack of children have grown, to the point where it cannot be denied: for whatever reason, whether it be the will of [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] or a more physical ailment, [From.GetSheHe] is unable to have children at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_35;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] has decided to set you aside. As of this moment, by the laws of the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith, you are no longer married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_marriage_35;That bitch! How dare she!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_marriage_35;That bastard! How dare he!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_marriage_36;News has reached you that [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] has decided to set aside your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. According to the [FromFromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith, the two are no longer married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
