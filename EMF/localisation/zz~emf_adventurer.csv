#### EVENTS ####
EVTDESC_TOG_1201;Word has reached me that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has begun a campaign to take [From.GetHerHis] claimed titles by force. [From.GetSheHeCap] is touring the lands, trying to raise coin to hire mercenaries and drum up support for [From.GetHerHis] cause. Whether [From.GetSheHe] might succeed remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1215;[From.GetTitledFirstName] recently arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], and has formally presented [From.GetHerHim]self at court: 'My [Root.GetLordLady], I am on a campaign to retake my rightful titles from [adventurer_target.GetTitledName]. With your blessing, I wish to raise support here in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] for my growing army.'
EVTOPTA_TOG_1215;[From.GetSheHeCap] has my full support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_1215;[From.GetSheHeCap] may recruit in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TOG_1215;Refuse and send [From.GetHerHim] away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_TOG_1215;Perhaps [adventurer_target.GetTitledFirstName] would pay a ransom for [From.GetHerHim]...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1216;News regarding [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]: [FromFrom.GetSheHe] continues to seek support in order to raise an army against you, and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] campaign has most recently brought [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], where [From.GetTitledFirstName] has declared [From.GetHerHis] full support for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1216;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_1216;I don't need to be told [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s every movement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1217;News regarding [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]: [FromFrom.GetHerHis] campaign recently brought [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and while [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not offer personal support, [From.GetSheHe] did allow [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] to look for recruits in the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1217;We'll see how far [FromFrom.GetSheHe] gets...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1218;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nAs you may have heard, I have been given leave by [From.GetTitledFirstName] to seek support in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] for my campaign to retake my titles from [adventurer_target.GetTitledName]. If there is anything you can provide to support my cause, I would be forever grateful.\n\nSigned,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1218;Of course I will help [FromFrom.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_1218;Ignore [FromFrom.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1220;You were all smiles, welcoming [FromFrom.GetTitledName] into your court...whether [FromFrom.GetSheHe] saw through you is uncertain, but regardless [FromFrom.GetSheHe] managed to escape from a trap you set on the road just outside of [Root.Capital.GetName] and has now fled [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1221;Success! You were all smiles as you welcomed [FromFrom.GetTitledName] into your court, setting a trap for [FromFrom.GetHerHim] on the road just outside of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Your soldiers took [FromFrom.GetHerHim] prisoner, and already a message is off to [adventurer_target.GetTitledName] to inquire about a possible ransom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1222;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nA certain young [FromFrom.GetManWoman] who has been raising an army against you, [FromFrom.GetTitledName], foolishly came to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to beg for handouts. Currently [FromFrom.GetSheHe] resides in my dungeon, but I would be pleased to offer [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to you for a small ransom.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1222;Pay the ransom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_1222;[From.GetSheHeCap] may do with [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] as [From.GetSheHe] sees fit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1223;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nYour terms are most agreeable, and I thank you for your assistance in bringing [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] to proper justice.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1224;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nWhile I would like [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] to see proper justice, I cannot agree to your terms for ransom. Do with the [FromFromFrom.GetManWoman] as you see fit.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1224;Then [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] goes free, I suppose;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_1224;Perhaps someone else will pay for [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1231;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nAs you may have heard, I have begun a campaign to see my rightful titles restored to me, even if that means raising an army against [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstName]. Any assistance you can offer would be most welcome, and will be remembered.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1231;Of course I will help [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_1231;Ignore [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1232;According to your spies, [From.GetTitledName] has thrown [From.GetHerHis] support to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], offering the [FromFrom.GetManWoman] a good deal of coin to support [FromFrom.GetHerHis] growing army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1232;A waste of coin, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1240;[From.GetTitledName], still campaigning to raise an army against you, is reportedly making good progress. Your spymaster reports that [From.GetSheHe] is currently in [From.Location.GetName], accompanied by several large mercenary bands lured with the promise of coin. At this rate, [From.GetSheHe] could potentially be ready to march within six months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1240;That's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1241;After years of trying and failing to raise an army large enough to challenge you, [From.GetTitledName] has finally admitted defeat and given up on [From.GetHerHis] quest. [From.GetSheHeCap] remains in [From.Location.GetName], where [From.GetSheHe] will likely live out the remainder of [From.GetHerHis] life in obscurity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1241;Nice try, [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1242;Good news! At last report, [From.GetTitledName] is bed-ridden in [From.Location.GetName] and barely able to speak...much less continue [From.GetHerHis] quest to raise an army against you. It appears [From.GetHerHis] threat to make good on [From.GetHerHis] claims against you are now much like [From.GetHerHis] mind: gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1242;I would feel bad for [From.GetHerHim], but...no;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1243;Considering [From.GetFirstName] is now the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and much too concerned with the day-to-day business of rulership, [From.GetHerHis] quest to raise an army against you has apparently been completely abandoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1243;So much for all those donations to [From.GetHerHis] cause, hm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1248;News has reached you of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s death, thereby ending [From.GetHerHis] ambition of taking [From.GetHerHis] claimed titles from you by force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1248;I can't say I'm sorry to hear that;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_1253;The commander of the forces recruited to take your titles reports to you: 'We have served you long and well, my [Root.GetLordLady], but with the end to your wars so does our time of service end. We wish you well.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_1253;It was good while it lasted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
