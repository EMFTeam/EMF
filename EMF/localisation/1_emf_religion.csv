adoptionist;Adoptionist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adoptionist_DESC;Adoptionists reject the Holy Trinity, believing that Jesus Christ was adopted as God's son at his ascension, chosen because of his sinless devotion to the will of God. They do not revere the Holy Mary, and were declared a Christian heresy at the end of the 2nd Century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apostolic;Apostolic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apostolic_DESC;Sometimes referred to as 'Gregorian', this was one of the early Christian faiths founded in Armenia by the Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus.

Learned Apostolics may subscribe to the Alexandrite school of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arian;Arian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arian_DESC;Arianism is a nontrinitarian belief that asserts that Jesus Christ is a Son of God, created by God the Father, distinct from the Father and therefore subordinate to the Father.

haruri;Haruri;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haruri_DESC;The Haruri are a sect from the period of the Four Rightly-Guided Caliphs, named for their first leader, Habib ibn-Yazid al-Haruri. The Haruri were originally one branch of the Khariji 'Rejectors' movement, so called because they rejected Ali's right to the Caliphate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili;Isma'ili;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili_DESC;The Isma'ilis believe that, when the 6th Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq died, his true successor was not Musa al-Kazim as the others believe, but in fact was the already dead Isma'il and his son Muhammad. The line of Isma'il has been in hiding for years, but now has emerged to reclaim the Caliphate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mahdiyya;Mahdite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mahdiyya_DESC;The Mahdites believe that the messiah, or Mahdi, has already risen, and given his commandments that clarify the Qur'an such that no other interpretation is valid. They are led by their own Caliphate of successors to the Mahdi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandaean;Mandaean;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandaean_DESC;Mandaeism is a gnostic religion with a strongly dualistic worldview. Its adherents revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enosh, Noah, Shem, Aram and especially John the Baptist, but reject Abraham, Moses and Jesus of Nazareth. It is represented in-game as an early form of Manichaeism, and a potential heresy should it resurface.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
manichean_DESC;Manichaeism is a Gnostic religion founded by the prophet Mani, who was put to death by the Sassanid Shahanshah Bahram I in 277. His 'Religion of Light' incorporated elements of Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Gnosticism. At one point, Manichaeism spread far and wide, and was the biggest competitor with Christianity for replacing classical Paganism until it began to fade in the 6th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
manichean_FEATURES;§Y*§! The Manichaean Archegos exists in the Old Gods and Charlemagne bookmarks, and may be restored later\n§Y*§! Manichaeans have their own holy festival, the Bema Feast\n§Y*§! Manichaeans may elect to dedicate themselves to a Shekhinah upon adulthood;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maronite;Maronite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Learned Maronites may subscribe to either the Antiochian or Alexandrite schools of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_DESC;The Messalians, or Euchites ('Those who Pray'), are a heretical Christian sect that originated in Mesopotamia, influenced by dualistic faiths like Zoroastrianism. Messalians believe that God can be perceived by the carnal senses, and that this perception is necessary to reach perfection. Each person is born with an inner demon, and only intense prayer can drive it out. They also believe that Lucifer is the elder son of God and a force for good, and that incest is sacred since it was practised by the children of Adam and Eve. They have no formal rites and no strict church hierarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_FEATURES;§Y*§! Messalians must pray to expel their personal demons\n§Y*§! Once the demons are driven out, they can achieve the status of Perfection\n§Y*§! Learned Messalians may subscribe to the Antiochian school of theology\n§Y*§! Messalians may choose a patron saint to worship\n§Y*§!

miaphysite;Coptic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
miaphysite_DESC;Copts are miaphysite, stressing that Christ had but a single nature, but of both human and divine character. This stance split them off from the main branch of Christianity after the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Though not viewed as outright heretics by Orthodox and Catholic Christians, it is a fine distinction. The nominal head of the Coptic Church is the Pope of Alexandria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
miaphysite_FEATURES;§Y*§! Copts may opt to become Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers instead of monks and nuns\n§Y*§! Learned Copts may subscribe to the Alexandrite school of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
syriac;West Syriac;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
syriac_DESC;Syriac Orthodox Christians, also known as Jacobites after their founder Jacob Baradeus are Miaphysite Christians, stressing that Christ had but a single nature, but of both human and divine character.

Though not viewed as outright heretics by Orthodox and Catholic Christians, it is a fine distinction. The nominal head of the Syriac Orthodox Church is the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monophysite_DESC;Monophysitism is an early Christian heresy which states that Christ had but a single nature.

nabawiyya;Nabawite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nabawiyya_DESC;The Nabawites believe that the Qur'an was only the holy book for the Arabs, and that they have their own holy book and prophet, just as legitimate, sent by God for their people, modelled on Islam. They are led by a Malik, similar to the Muslim Caliph.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nestorian_DESC;The Church of the East or East Syriac Christianity is a Christian branch which states that Christ has two separate natures - one divine and one human. This theological position was originally put forward from the Theological school of Edessa and had a powerful champion in the Patriarch of Constantinople, Nestorius, but was condemned as heresy in 431. The Church of the East never accepted this condemnation though and Westerners have since then for varying reasons applied the term Nestorian to the Church of the East. The nominal head of the Church of the East is the Patriarch of the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nestorian_FEATURES;§Y*§! Learned East Syriac Christians may subscribe to the Antiochian school of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
obj_become_saint_desc;A true saint can only be created after one's death, but it is possible to embark upon that path while one is still alive. It is not an easy journey, requiring humility and a dedication to religious ideals, but success means that one will enjoy piety and recognition -- and perhaps a greater chance of beatification after one's passing. Failure, however, can mean a loss of piety and worse, and failure will be far more likely the more sinful traits one possesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
obj_become_saint_title;Become a Saint;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paulician_DESC;Paulicianism is Christian Gnostic heresy influenced by Manichaeism, originating in Armenia, and known for its militarist attitude and emphasis on only accepting the New Testament as legitimate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

qarmatian;Qarmati;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
qarmatian_DESC;The Qarmatians are a extreme splinter sect of Isma'ili Islam, and believe that there are seven ages of man, each with a new religion and prophet, and the final age is approaching. They believe that the rest of the Isma'ilis have lost the faith, and that Muhammad son of Isma'il is still in hiding, waiting to return as the Mahdi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tondrakian;Tondrakian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tondrakian_DESC;Tondrakians are an anti-feudal, anti-church sect that originally flourished in Armenia between the 9th and 11th Century.

waqifi;Waqifite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

zurvanist;Zurvanist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zurvanist_DESC;Zurvanism is a branch of Zoroastrianism that believes in the existence of Zurvan, a genderless god of of infinite time (and space), for whom there is no distinction between good and evil. Zurvan is the parent of the two opposites representing the good god, Ahura Mazda, and the evil Angra Mainyu, unlike normal Zoroastrianism, where Ahura Mazda is the Supreme Being. Zurvanism is further divided by its three schools of thought: Aesthetic, Fatalistic and Materialistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##### LAWS #####
#
bureaucratic_infighting;Court Infighting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bureaucratic_infighting_desc;If a ruler's court grows out of their control, the results can be devastating. It's entirely possible for the [Root.GetFullName] to fly apart at the seams. Even if it doesn't, it will become increasingly difficult for the ruler to exert influence over members of their court -- or keep them within the [Root.GetFullName] after their death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_0;Court in Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_0_option;Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_0_desc;The court is currently out of control, with rulers all but ignoring the throne's authority as they vie with each other for greater power and influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_1;Order Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_1_option;Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_1_desc;Order has been restored in the ruler's court, with authority from the crown once again being respected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priesthood;[fraticelli.GetName] Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priesthood_desc;While all [fraticelli.GetPriestTitle]s are initially monastic in nature, just as within the [catholic.GetName] Church, the [fraticelli.GetName] belief is that it is imperative for [fraticelli.GetPriestTitle]s to take a more active role in the spreading of the faith and the operation of government. Thus a [fraticelli.GetName] ruler is able to determine whether those ideals will be enforced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_0;Monastic Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_0_option;Monastic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_0_desc;[fraticelli.GetPriestTitleCap]s spend their time in seclusion, dedicating themselves utterly to their faith and to [fraticelli.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_1;Apostolic Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_1_option;Apostolic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_1_desc;[fraticelli.GetPriestTitleCap]s are required to go out amongst the masses and spread the faith. Even the highest ranking bishop is expected to be a missionary, actively counseling the poor away from the confines of his [Root.Holder.GetHouseOfWorship].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_2;Bureaucratic Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_2_option;Bureaucratic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priest_2_desc;[fraticelli.GetPriestTitleCap]s are called upon to serve at the pleasure of their lord, taking an active part in the administration of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
investiture_law_desc;This law determines who appoints [Root.Holder.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s - the head of the religion or the secular liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
investiture_law_0;Religious Head Investiture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
investiture_law_0_option;Head;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
investiture_law_0_desc;Only the [Root.Holder.Religion.GetName] [Root.Holder.RelHead.GetTitle] may appoint [Root.Holder.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s within the [Root.GetFullName]. This will give the Crown a §G50%§! [Root.Holder.Religion.GetPietyName] cost discount when requesting special actions like Divorce and Excommunication.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
investiture_law_1_desc;[Root.Holder.Religion.GetPriestTitleCap]s within the [Root.GetFullName] can be appointed by their secular lieges, and will be more loyal to their liege. The [Root.Holder.Religion.GetName] [Root.Holder.RelHead.GetTitle] will not be pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maz_wealth_group;Wealth Sharing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maz_wealth_group_desc;One of Mazdak's primary teachings was that the [d_zoroastrian.GetFullName] oppressed its people, and hoarded its wealth. He believed that wealth should be shared, and espoused ideas of egalitarianism that were way ahead of his time. A ruler of proper faith should, by the [mazdaki.GetName] faith, set aside a large share of its taxes for the people -- and force their vassals to do the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_0;No Wealth Sharing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_0_desc;There is no system of wealth sharing, just as it has always been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_0_option;None;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_1;Minimal Wealth Sharing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_1_desc;The [mazdaki.GetName] nobility must put aside a token amount of wealth for the people -- more for show than anything substantial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_1_option;Minimal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_2;Basic Wealth Sharing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_2_desc;The [mazdaki.GetName] nobility must put aside a portion of their wealth and taxes in order to subsidize the poorest of the poor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_2_option;Basic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_3;High Wealth Sharing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_3_desc;A large amount of the taxes and wealth possessed by the nobility must go towards the people -- the building of shelters for the poor, the standard granting of gifts for the ill-favored, and the construction of hospitals for the sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_3_option;High;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_4;Maximum Wealth Sharing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_4_desc;The portion of wealth and taxes which are set aside for the common people goes far beyond what even Mazdak would have thought possible. The people would be very happy under such a regime, feeling as if a large amount of the work they do for their rulers are returned to them in kind. The nobility, however, will be far less pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_4_option;Max;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
waldensian_charity_law;[waldensian.GetName] Charity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
waldensian_charity_law_desc;All [waldensian.GetName] rulers are required to give a healthy amount of their wealth to the poor. The question is whether the act is an optional one, or whether such charity will be required by law amongst the ruler's vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wald_charity_0;Optional Charity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wald_charity_0_option;Optional;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wald_charity_0_desc;All charity amongst rulers is provided at their own volition. Unsurprisingly, this does not happen very often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wald_charity_1;Enforced Charity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wald_charity_1_option;Enforced;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wald_charity_1_desc;Charity amongst rulers is required by law -- a portion of all taxes are given to the poor, something that is appreciated by the [waldensian.GetName] Church but rather disliked among feudal vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bogomilist_merchant_republic_government;Patareni Merchant Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_merchant_republic_government_desc;Playing as a Patrician within a Patareni Merchant Republic is not entirely dissimilar from playing a Patareni lord - you are still after more Holdings, and you need an heir of your family. However, leadership of the Republic changes between the five major Patrician families through special elections. Patricians can also build a network of Trade Posts, even in the counties of other powers...;Jouer un patricien au sein d'une république marchande patareni est semblable à l'expérience qu'offre un seigneur patareni: vous cherchez toujours à posséder davantage de propriétés et vous devez avoir un héritier pour votre famille. Cependant, la gouvernance de votre république tourne entre les cinq familles patriciennes majeures par le biais d'élections spéciales. Les patriciens peuvent ainsi construire un réseau de comptoirs, même dans les comtés qui dépendent d'autres régimes...;Als Patrizier einer patareni Handelsrepublik zu spielen, ähnelt dem Spiel als patareni Herrscher. Nach wie vor ist der Erwerb neuer Liegenschaften Euer Ziel und auch für einen Erben müsst Ihr sorgen. Allerdings gibt es innerhalb einer Republik spezielle Wahlen, durch die festgelegt wird, welche der fünf großen Patrizierfamilien die politische Führung der Republik übernimmt. Daneben können Patrizier ein Netzwerk von Handelsposten aufbauen, sogar auf dem Gebiet anderer Mächte ...;;Encarnar a un patricio de una república mercante patareni no es completamente diferente a encarnar a un señor patareni: sigues tratando de hacerte con más propiedades y necesitas un heredero en tu familia. No obstante, el liderazgo de la República cambia entre las cinco familias de patricios principales a través de unas elecciones especiales.

## Out-commented due to Mirath not yet being ready:
#muslim_government_desc;The [arabic.GetGroupName] Iqta system is similar to the Feudal system - rulers must rely on land holding vassals of varying loyalty and ambition. The maximum number of vassals and the number of Holdings you can directly own are controlled by the Centralization Law. However, there is only one form of Succession available - the chaotic 'Mirath' type, where inheritance is split up between heirs but the primary heir can be chosen. If you should convert to a non-[muslim.GetGroupName] religion, your government form will change to Feudal.;Le système [arabic.GetGroupName] de l'iqtâ est similaire au système féodal  les souverains doivent faire appel à des vassaux pour tenir leurs propriétés et le degré d'ambition ou de loyauté de ces derniers peut varier. Le nombre maximal de vassaux et le nombre de propriétés que vous pouvez directement posséder sont contrôlés par la loi de centralisation. Cependant, il n'y a qu'une seule forme de succession disponible  la succession « Mirath » chaotique, selon laquelle l'héritage est partagé entre les héritiers mais l'héritier principal peut être choisi. Si vous vous convertissez à une religion non [muslim.GetGroupName], votre type de gouvernement deviendra féodal.;Das [arabic.GetGroupName]e Iqtasystem ähnelt dem Feudalsystem. Auch hier muss der Herrscher auf möglicherweise unzuverlässige Vasallen vertrauen. In den Zentralisierungsgesetzen ist festgelegt, wie viele Besitztümer und wie viele Vasallen Ihr maximal haben könnt. Es gibt allerdings bei der Erbfolge nur eine einzige Variante: das chaotische "Mirath" System, bei dem die Erbschaft zwischen den Erben aufgeteilt wird, aber der primäre Erbe kann gewählt werden. Wenn Ihr zu einer nicht [muslim.GetGroupName]en Religionsgruppe konvertieren solltet, wird Eure Regierungsform zur Feudalregierung geändert;;El sistema [arabic.GetGroupName] Iqta es similar al sistema feudal - los gobernantes deben depender de vasallos con posesiones territoriales de variable lealtad y ambición. El número máximo número de vasallos y de posesiones que puedes poseer directamente puedes poseer están controlados por la ley de centralización. Sin embargo, solo existe una forma de sucesión: la caótica 'Mirath', donde la herencia se divide entre herederos, pero el heredero primario puede ser elegido. Si te conviertes a una religión no [muslim.GetGroupName] tu forma de gobierno cambiará a feudal.;;;;;;;;;x

begin_formalize_bogomilist_church;Begin Formalization of the [bogomilist.GetName] Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
begin_formalize_bogomilist_church_desc;The formalization of the [bogomilist.GetName] faith into a structured organization supported by the state will take a great deal of work. It can be done slowly over time, or more quickly provided you have both the respect and [bogomilist.GetPietyName]. Either way, there are likely to be repercussions from those of the faithful who resist such changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cathar_adoption;Adopt an Heir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cathar_adoption_desc;For many of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, heirs cannot be acquired in the normal fashion. Thus it is quite acceptable for a ruler to adopt an orphaned [Root.Religion.GetName] child and raise it as their ownan act of generosity, if you will, towards someone who in any other circumstance would have few chances at a meaningful life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cathar_consolamentum;Consolamentum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cathar_consolamentum_desc;The only sacrament of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, the Consolamentum represented a purification of the faithful from sins gained throughout their life. Once the ritual baptism had occurred, the faithful [Root.Religion.GetName] would be considered 'Perfect' and be expected to live a life of celibacy -- as well as to spread the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith further. Most did not receive Consolamentum until their deathbeds, but the zealous would take the sacrament much earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_imamah;Claim [d_ismaili.GetRulerTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_imamah_desc;The descendants of Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad, hold a special place amongst those of the [ismaili.GetName] faith -- the head of the dynasty is considered the [d_ismaili.GetRulerTitle], and primary claimant to the [d_ismaili.GetFullName]. With no clear [d_ismaili.GetRulerTitle] currently existing, it falls on the head of the Fatimid dynasty to step forward and assume the responsibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

create_cathar_papacy;Create the [d_cathar.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
create_cathar_papacy_desc;A truly great ruler, dedicated to the cause of the [cathar.GetName]s and a true Perfectus, might be able to raise up a member of the faithful as a [d_cathar.GetRulerTitle]: a leader for the faithful everywhere, and able to direct his or her religion to spread throughout the known world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

declare_religious_emancipation;Declare [Root.Religion.GetName] Emancipation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
declare_religious_emancipation_desc;The [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is considered a heresy, but perhaps that need not be the case. With an officially-ordained head of our religion and a [Root.Religion.GetName] champion of sufficient esteem to sponsor a place for negotiations to take place, perhaps we could divorce ourselves from heresy and be treated as an offshoot from our parent religion instead... if they will let us go without a fight, that is. Doing so means giving up on any hope of supplanting them as the 'official' faith, but is that what we really want?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

force_formalize_bogomilist_church;Force [bogomilist.GetName] Formalization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
force_formalize_bogomilist_church_desc;A leader of enough [bogomilist.GetPietyName] and standing could force a formalization of the [bogomilist.GetName] faith far more quickly than would otherwise be possible. This will mean any repercussions from the faithful will happen immediately, but so will the reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
formalize_bogomilist_church;Formalize the [bogomilist.GetName] Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
formalize_bogomilist_church_desc;Enough work has been done to organize the [bogomilist.GetName] faith for it to now be considered to have a structure of its own.

lollard_translate_bible;Translate [Root.Religion.GetScriptureNameCap];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lollard_translate_bible_desc;One of the ways the [k_papal_state.GetFullName] maintains its dominance over the common man is by ensuring that almost nobody can read [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. Perhaps the time has come to take the scripture out of the hands of the few and put it into the hands of the masses by ordering a translation of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] into the vernacular. It would be an incredibly expensive proposition, and take years to complete, but it would be a terrible blow to [catholic.GetName] authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mazdaki_restore_priesthood_desc;While Mazdak railed against the oppression of the [d_zoroastrian.GetFullName], now that his teachings have spread across all of [k_persia.GetName] perhaps the time has come to institue an organized priesthood of our own -- one that espouses the egalitarian principles upon which the [mazdaki.GetName] faith is founded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

messalian_castrate;Castrate Yourself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_castrate_desc;Follow in the path of the Saint Sabas Apokopos, one of the founders of the [messalian.GetName] sect, and castrate yourself.

miaphysite_embrace_alexandrine;Embrace Alexandrine School;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
miaphysite_embrace_alexandrine_desc;Those of advanced learning in eastern churches tend to lean towards one of two schools of theology -- the Alexandrine School emphasizes the allergorical interpretation of scriptures, and tends to a more pragmatic approach towards the advancement of science and thought... even if that can lead to conflict with the zealous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
miaphysite_embrace_antiochene;Embrace Antiochian School;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
miaphysite_embrace_antiochene_desc;Those of advanced learning in eastern churches tend to lean towards one of two schools of theology -- The Antiochan School leans toward a more literal interpretation of scriptures, and focuses more on tradition and the advancement of culture... even if that can lead to conflict with those of a more cynical or progressive view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

vassalize_religion_head_desc;The leader of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith acts as a veritable exile -- without a [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] to call their own, a demesne from which to call out to the faithful, and without real legitimacy in the eyes of the world.

EVTDESC67012;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been approached by the [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], and is clearly disregarding our lawful rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC67021;The [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] is asking us to replace our liege, and is giving us the divine right to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA67021;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] save the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC67022;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is a rebel and a traitor. The false sweet words of the false [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] has swayed [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_155_manichean;Your piety has been rewarded. [Root.RelHead.GetTitledName] has granted you the title of Apostle, and anointed you as one of the electors who shall choose [Root.RelHead.GetHerHis] successor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_160A;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has requested to join the [join_holy_order.GetName] in their struggle against the infidels, even though this will forever disinherit [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_160B;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has requested to join the [join_holy_order.GetName] in their struggle against the infidels. It is a dangerous adventure [From.GetSheHe] seeks, but [From.GetSheHe] appears determined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_226;Choosing the Shekhinah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_226;The [manichean.GetName]s believed there were five 'Shekhinah', which are the elements where the Divine dwells. Each [manichean.GetName] can choose an element upon which to focus, and once chosen that focus cannot be changed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_226;I will focus upon Haunâ, or Reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_226;I will focus upon Madde'â, or Mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_226;I will focus upon Reyana, or Intelligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_heresy_226;There are other Shekhinah to consider...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_227;I will focus upon Mahíabtâ, or Thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_227;I will focus upon Tar'îtâ, or Understanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_228;The New [d_manichean.GetRulerTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_228;After the [manichean.GetName] [d_manichean.GetRulerTitle] was murdered by the [d_sunni.GetRulerTitle] in Baghdad, many thought that was the end of the religion as an organized church. But like a phoenix rising from its ashes, [new_manichean_leader.GetTitledName] has been proclaimed the new [d_manichean.GetRulerTitle] by [Root.GetTitledName], with the [manichean.GetName] faith having enough power now to make him no mere charlatan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_228;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_228;And so the heresy grows more powerful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_229;The [d_army_light.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_229;The growing power of the [manichean.GetName]s can no longer be denied. With the aid of [Root.GetTitledName], a group of fanatics, peasants, and madmen have now banded together to create their own army, to smite heathens and infidels and to protect the righteous. They call themselves the [d_army_light.GetFullName], and their holy mission is to fight for the cause of good -- in the eyes of the [manichean.GetName]s -- and drive darkness out of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_229;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_231;My [Root.GetLordLady], this extremely generous donation will not be forgotten. You have my friendship, as well as that of the [manichean.GetName] Church. Rest assured that you will be rewarded in the afterlife, if not on Earth!\nYours in faith,\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_233;My [Root.GetLordLady], this antagonism is completely unwarranted! The [d_army_light.GetFullName] serves [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], but, one has to wonder, do you?\n\nWith anger and sadness,\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_234;Religious leaders from the province of Baghdad are complaining about the prevelance of [manichean.GetName] worshippers. 'It is horrible that you can not walk down a street in Baghdad without tripping over half a dozen [manichean.GetName]s. Why should we let these infidels continue to live while they tempt others away from the true faith?' They are asking that something be done, lest this become an even greater problem in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_234;We shall crush the [d_manichean.GetRulerTitle] and his followers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_234;No, I will not attack the innocent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_235;[manichean.GetName]s Slaughtered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_235;The province of Baghdad was once the center of the [manichean.GetName] faith, home to [manichean_leader.GetTitledName] who is their leader. After complaints by [Root.Religion.GetName] worshippers, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has begun a slaughter of all [manichean.GetName]s in the region -- beginning with [manichean_leader.GetTitledFirstName] and so ravaging the population that the scholar Ibn al-Nadim reports only finding five remaining in the entire city after the pogrom was finished. The [manichaen.GetName] position of [d_manichean.GetRulerTitle] now lies empty, and looks to remain so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_235;An outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_235;So must it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_236;After the battle is over, your soldiers hail the victory as a great triumph of the [d_army_light.GetFullName] over your foes, in service to the Army of Darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_236;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] watches over us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_237;After the battle is over, your soldiers curse the defeat as a great triumph of the Army of Darkness over the [d_army_light.GetFullName], and shiver in their sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_237;It is the work of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_238;You have begun preparations for the Bema Feast, to celebrate the life and death of the Prophet Mani. You send out messengers with invitations to your vassals, expecting all to come and honor [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_238;This year it will be very special!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_239;Dear vassal,\nI hereby invite you to attend the celebration of the Bema Feast at [From.Capital.GetName].\n\nYour Liege,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_239;Of course I will go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_239;No, I will not attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_240;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nAlas, I will not be able to attend the Bema Feast. I will offer thanks to Mani in a much more humble affair at [From.Capital.GetName], but I do appreciate your invitation.\n\nWith sincerity,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_240;The nerve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_241;Guests have arrived from villages throughout the realm, to celebrate the Bema Feast in [Root.Capital.GetName]. The festivities are almost ready to begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_242;Guests have arrived from villages throughout [Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName], to celebrate the Bema Feast in [Liege.Capital.GetName]. [Liege.GetTitledFirstName] greets you at the entrance to [Liege.GetHerHis] estate, and it seems the festivities are almost ready to begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_243;The Bema Feast is over for now. Another celebration of Light to drive back the Darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_246;It is customary to fast in religious reflection before the start of the Bema Feast. Will you take part in this tradition?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_246;I will fast for a week!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_246;I will fast for the next three days!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_246;Go without food? Perish the thought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_247;The Singing of Hymns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_247;The Bema Feast starts with the singing of various hymns that celebrate the return of spring, the life and death of the Prophet Mani, and the battles the Forces of Light have won over the Armies of Darkness. All those gathered raise their voices to the gods, a chorus of faith and beauty that touches the soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_247;This is my favorite part!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_250;The Feast of the Elect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_250;Only the Elect -- those who are devoted to the [manichean.GetName] faith -- are invited to take part in a ritual meal, which both symbolizes the life of Mani and the theology of the [manichean.GetName]s. To take part is a great honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_250;Honor and Glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_251;The Presentation of the Arzhang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_251;The Arzhang, or Picture Book, is a work painted by Mani himself, which depicts the [manichean.GetName] theology in simple terms, so that even the uneducated can read and understand the faith. The book rests on the bema until the feast is over, after which a [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] recites sermons from it and absolves the sins of those attending.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_251;Praise be to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_257;The [persian.GetName] Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_257;It is said that the Abbasids would never have been able to seize the [d_sunni.GetFullName] without the aid of the great [persian.GetName] general, Abu Muslim, who in the end was rewarded for his service with death -- executed on the order of [d_sunni.GetRulerTitle] Al-Mansur. Resentment for this perceived betrayal has long simmered as resentment among the [persian.GetName] people, resentment which has now broken out in open rebellion. A peasant leader by the name of Babak, aided by his capable wife Banu, an effective general and archer in her own right, has risen up to free his nation from the unjust rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstName]... and has already attracted a massive following, enough to present a real threat to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_257;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_257;It's about time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_258;The [d_mazdaki.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_258;Although the Prophet Mazdak always railed against the corruption of the [d_zoroastrian.GetFullName], and his followers have never had an official structure to speak of, now that the faith has risen to such prominence under [Root.GetTitledName] it seems the time has come to give it to them. With [new_mazdaki_leader.GetTitledFirstName] chosen as the new [new_mazdaki_leader.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of the [new_mazdaki_leader.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], the [mazdaki.GetName] faith has entered a new era, with a priesthood rivalling that of the [zoroastrian.GetName]s from which they once stemmed... and have, perhaps, now exceeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_258;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_259;The [mazdaki.GetName] teach there are four Powers that bring Light into the World: Discernment, Understanding, Preservation, and Joy. Any adult member of the faith may embrace one of these Powers. in an attempt to achieve eventual perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_259;I choose the Power of Discernment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_259;I choose the Power of Understanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_259;I choose the Power of Preservation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_heresy_259;I choose the Power of Joy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_260;You have begun preparations for the Tawûsgeran festival, also known as the 'Circulation of the Peacock'. You send out messengers with invitations to your [yazidi.GetName] vassals, expecting all to come and honor Melek Taus, greatest among the seven angels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_260;I've been looking forward to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_261;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nThe time has come once again for us all to celebrate the Tawûsgeran, a time to honor Melek Taus - He who is most holy amongst the seven angels. The festival will take place in [From.Capital.GetName], and you are hereby formally invited to attend.\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_263;The Tawûsgeran festival is well under way when you finally arrive in [FromFrom.Capital.GetName]. [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitleCap]s walk throughout the crowds, giving out vials of holy water to the faithful. You can hear the holy rites to the Seven being chanted at shrines everywhere you walk, though the name of Melek Taus is most prominent amongst them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_263;An excellent time, to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_264;Peasants are streaming into [Root.Capital.GetName] from all over [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] for the beginning of the Tawûsgeran festival, and already your vassals are arriving. The chanting of rites to Melek Taus can be heard from the many shrines at your window, and soon the true celebrations will begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_265;The Circulation of the Peacock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_265;The Circulation of the Peacock is about to start! In accordance with tradition, [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s and pious men carry the senjaq, statues of the Seven Archangels, in circles around the city as they distribute blessings. To carry one of the statues is an honor reserved for only those of great wisdom and [Root.Religion.GetPietyName], as well as an event requiring considerable strength and willpower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_265;I wish to carry one of the statues!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_265;I am content to watch the proceedings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_266;As you carry the senjaq around, you discover that it is rather heavier than you expected. The unaccustomed weight causes you to stumble, and the idol slips out of your hands and crashes down to the ground and is damaged. Everyone stares in horror as you quickly pick it back up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_266;Only a few people saw that... right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_267;As you carry the heavy senjaq around, the weight and the heat begin to take their toll upon you. As if in a dream, you begin to hear the voices of the Seven Archangels talking, telling you secrets and mysteries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_267;They have visited me! I am blessed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_268;With each step of the Circulation, more and more of the truth of your faith is reveled to you. Of course this is the proper path. How could any man doubt such a truth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_268;For the glory of Menek Taus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_269;Perhaps it is the power of faith that fills you, but what once seemed so heavy at the beginning now feels as light as feather. Why, you could carry this senjaq around all day if the priests would let you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_269;Strength comes from faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_270;Veneration of the Senjaq;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_270;After the senjaq have been paraded around the city, the populace of the city comes forward to present their sacrifices and tributes. You visit each senjaq in turn, praying for the wisdom of the Seven Archangels, venerating them with holy incense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_270;For Wisdom and Honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_271;Gifts From the Pious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_271;The final stage of the Tawûsgeran festival is the collection of alms from the pious. Every man and woman is expected to give, a contribution to the greater faith and in support of those in need. While most give only a few coins, those who are able are expected to give much more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_271;I am a pious [Root.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_271;I will give what I must, no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_271;Ignore this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_272;The final ceremony is a grand sermon of thanksgiving to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and his servants. It was a rousing sermon as always, and the crowd begins the feast with great abandon. Another glorious celebration of the Seven Archangels has been completed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_272;Praise the Seven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_273;The Tawûsgeran is over for now, and already the many decorations are being taken down. Melek Taus has been properly honored, and the realm is looking forward to a bright future under His wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_273;Until next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_277;Sadly, the death of [From.GetTitledFirstName] means the Circulation of the Peacock must be canceled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_277;Such is how it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_278;A glorious day for us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_279;The pilgrimage to Lalish, a site just outside of the bustling city of Mosul, is one of the most important journeys a [yazidi.GetName] can undertake. There one attends the Feast of the Assembly, and returns filled with the spirit and strength of the Seven Archangels... or so the story goes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_280;The day has come. Your belongings are packed, arrangements have been made for matters in [Root.Capital.GetName] to be attended to while you are away, and your departure has been kept quiet to prevent the unsavory from taking advantage of your solitary journey. Now you must begin your journey to Lalish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_281;Arrival at Lalish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_281;You arrive in the bustling city of holy Mosul, and it is not long before you make your way to Lalish, a mountain valley village not far to the north. This sleepy place is where the [yazidi.GetName] faith truly began, and as the Feast of the Assembly unfolds, prayers offered to the Seven Archangels up in the heavens, you marvel at the conical roofs of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir's tomb. The rest of your stay will be spent in Mosul, but you cannot help but feel overcome at having taken a path so many have walked before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_281;Now, what to do next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_285;The [yazidi.GetName] Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_285;There are many who claim the [yazidi.GetName] to be devil-worshippers, due to their veneration of the Peacock Angel they call Melek Taus or Shaytan. This has led the [yazidi.GetName] to be considered [muslim.GetGroupName] heretics for countless generations, even though their religion incorporates syncretic elements of not only the [muslim.GetGroupName] faith but also Gnosticism and the [zoroastrian.GetName] faith. Now, with [Root.GetTitledName] having risen to such power, [Root.GetSheHe] has declared the [yazidi.GetName] to be their own faith and no heresy -- and [Root.GetSheHe] has the prestige to be listened to. In the end, it may change nothing save to the [yazidi.GetName] themselves, but even so it is a sign as to just how far they have come since the ancient days of worshipping at hidden [Root.GetHouseOfWorship]s in the Kurdish foothills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_285;Praise to Melek Taus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_285;They are still devil-worshippers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_1803;I do not need the title;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_1900;Anarchy at [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1900;Dire events are underway in [Root.Capital.GetName], capital to the mighty [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]: [Root.GetTitledFirstName], considered by many to be a weak caliph, has been turned into a veritable prisoner within his own palace. His advisors have taken control of the court, and already cracks have begun to appear in its authority over the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s vassals. Whether [Root.GetTitledFirstName] will be able to regain control or whether the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] will crumble into anarchy is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1900;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_1900;This travesty is an affront to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_1900;It couldn't happen to a nicer [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1901;While [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has taken command of the [d_sunni.GetFullName], the court remains firmly in control. You will have to be strong if you are to overcome their rule and restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1901;They will not get away with this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_1902;Order Restored in [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1902;It has taken a bloody coup, with [imprisoned_regent.GetTitledName] being overthrown and imprisoned, but [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has restored order in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. The [d_sunni.GetFullName] once again has authority respected by its vassals. It remains to be seen whether [Root.GetTitledFirstName] will exact more vengeance upon those of his court who kept him hostage, and whether he will be able to bring the lands he lost back under his fold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1902;Ha! Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_1902;This is a good thing, I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1904;The court of [From.GetTitledFirstName] runs rampant with anarchy and corruption. Perhaps it is time for the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] to declare its independence before the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] crumbles completely and takes you with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1904;Yes, let us make our own way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_1904;No, I am loyal to the [Root.RelHead.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1905;Alas, the anarchy rampant within the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] has claimed another victim: from your quarters in the palace, you hear that [From.GetTitledName] has declared [From.GetHerHis] independence from the [Root.RelHead.GetTitle] in pure disgust. Naturally your court is at odds regarding what to do about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1907;After the unjust murder of his son by local authorities, a follower of the [kharijite.GetName] sect of Islam by the name of Musawir ibn 'Abd al-Hamid al-Shari has launched an insurrection in the province of Mosul, aiming to toppling the rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstName] in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. This presents a serious threat to the [Root.RelHead.GetTitle], and further evidence of the reign of anarchy in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1907;[Root.Religion.GetGroupName] heretics in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]? Good news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

There has to be some other way...' Alas, there was not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1917_family;You are family, but this is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_spouse;[Root.GetTitledName], [Root.GetHusbandWife] of [From.GetTitledName], is dragged into the central square of [From.Capital.GetName], where a huge bonfire roars. In a last, desperate effort to save [Root.GetHerselfHimself], [Root.GetSheHe] calls out to [From.GetTitledFirstName]. 'I have always loved you, [Root.GetFirstName], and I always shall!' But it is not enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1917_spouse;Forgive me then, my love, but this is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_dynasty;[Root.GetTitledName] is brought up from the dungeons and placed at the block in front of a cheering crowd in [Root.Capital.GetName]'s central square. As they raise the sword above [Root.GetHerHis] neck, [Root.GetSheHe] cries out to the watching [From.GetTitledFirstName]: 'Don't do this, [From.GetFirstName]! We are family, and of the same blood!' But the sword descends even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1917_dynasty;It is not enough to save you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_saoshyant;[From.GetTitledFirstName] spits at the ragged creature curled into a ball before [From.GetHerHim]. 'King of Kings,' [From.GetSheHe] mocks, with a sharp kick to the kidneys, 'Bringer of Benefit. There is only one Bringer of Benefit, and that is [From.Religion.GetHighGodName], whose truth and love you have rejected for idolatry.' [From.GetSheHeCap] raises a great scimitar, shining steel reflecting the screaming crowd, and beheads [Root.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1917_saoshyant;I hope [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] has a special jinn waiting for your soul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_pope;[Root.GetTitledName] is dragged, stumbling and bloody, before a screaming crowd in [From.Capital.GetName]. [From.GetTitledFirstName] regards [Root.GetHerHim] and laughs. 'This broken old [Root.GetManWoman], covered in [Root.GetHerHis] own filth, dressed in ragged, once-fine robes, is the [Root.GetManWoman] who commanded a hundred legions of infidels to invade Dar al-Islam? You are so pathetic, it is not even worth the torture. Just cut off [Root.GetHerHis] head.' The attendants rush to do just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1917_pope;Pray your carpenter comes to save you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_patriarch;[Root.GetTitledName] flinches, but does not scream, as the nails are pounded through [Root.GetHerHis] hands.

But you should thank me! I am giving you the chance to die like your false savior!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1917_patriarch;I wonder if [Root.GetSheHe] sees [Root.GetHerHis] house from there;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_caliph;The blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd.

The [Root.GetManWoman] makes no response, save to spit in the ground before the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], sealing [Root.GetHerHis] fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1917_jewish_head;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_zoro_head;[Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a roaring bonfire and a wildly screaming crowd. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim]: 'All that work to restore your false religion, yet in the end it is undone once more. Your people worship fire, yes?' [From.GetSheHeCap] grins wickedly at the bonfire, radiating intense heat. 'Let us see how much it likes you.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1917_zoro_head;Not that much, as it turns out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_king_israel;[Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s jailors have not been kind to this so-called '[Root.GetKingQueen] of the [jewish_group.GetGroupName]s'. Body battered, face broken and bruised, yet [Root.GetSheHe] still stands tall against the jeering crowd.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_emperor;The bruised and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [From.GetTitledFirstName] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim]: 'All your worldly power, all those armies at your command. They are not but dust in the face of [From.Religion.GetHighGodName].' The command is given, and [Root.GetTitledFirstName] dies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1917_emperor;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] may show you mercy, but I shall not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_christian_head;The crowd in [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square screams wildly as the execution of [Root.GetTitledName] is carried out. [From.GetTitledFirstName] looks at the corpse of the [Root.GetManWoman], hanging broken and crucified upon the cross. 'I must give [Root.GetHerHim] credit,' [From.GetSheHe] says. '[Root.GetSheHeCap] did not cry out, not even in the end.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_1917_christian_head;A pity such a brave [Root.GetManWoman] followed a false religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_pagan_head;The bruised and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd.

'Or, rather, I am sorry I will not receive a ransom for you.' With those words, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s fate is sealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[From.GetTitledFirstName] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim] with a wry grin: 'They say you are a very clever [Root.GetManWoman]... but have you thought of a way to save yourself?' [Root.GetTitledFirstName] says nothing, and thus [Root.GetHerHis] fate is sealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1917_imbecile;The bruised and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. As [From.GetTitledFirstName] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim], [From.GetSheHe] realizes a certain amount of the jeers are directed at [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps slaying a drooling moron isn't the most dignified way to honour [From.Religion.GetHighGodName], or impress the people. Even so, it must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1923;It is the responsibility of every [kharijite.GetName] to spread the faith with determination and ardor.

EVTNAME_emf_heresy_1960;The Birth of the [druze.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1960;A [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] by the name of [druze_founder.GetFullName] has recently come to the court of [Root.GetBestName] with an ambitious project: to formally unite many of the movements within the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith that have opposed some of its more controversial ideas from the very beginning. [druze_founder.GetSheHeCap] has worked together for many months with a group of other [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s who share [druze_founder.GetHerHis] vision, collating and collecting the most appealing ideas from these movements, and they are now ready to reveal their work to the world. They are presenting their work as an improved version of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, one that incorporates many of its criticisms, while still remaining true to its core principles. However, many [Root.Religion.GetName] scholars are critical of [druze_founder.GetFirstName]'s teachings, calling them heretical. They claim that these teachings are less like an improvement more like a completely new religion, one they have named "[druze.GetName]". Nevertheless, [druze_founder.GetFullName] has now asked the esteemed [Root.GetBestName] to support [druze_founder.GetHerHis] new vision of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1961;One of the early factions within the followers of [druze_founder.GetBestName] believed that [ismaili.GetHighGodName] is incarnated in all human beings, especially those who are direct male descendants of the Prophet or his close relatives... and [From.GetBestName] happens to be one of them. Now that the [druze.GetName] have successfully started spread thanks in part to [From.GetHerHis] actions, this belief has not only become ever more popular amongst the [druze.GetName] faithful, but many have taken it even further, saying that [From.GetBestName] is the only incarnation of [ismaili.GetHighGodName], and that [From.GetSheHe] will lead the faith to glory. [druze_founder.GetBestName] has vehemently disagreed with this view and has tried [druze_founder.GetHerHis] best to change the minds of [druze_founder.GetHerHis] followers, saying that [ismaili.GetHighGodName] is divine while [From.GetBestName] is merely human, but to no avail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The partisans of Ali look to his descendants for leadership, but they are forced to keep their ancestry secret. Now though, they are mobilizing their strength behind a young man by the name of [ismaili_revolter.GetFirstName] whom they claim to be Isma'il's rightful heir and [d_ismaili.GetRulerTitle]. Other [ismaili.GetGroupName] jurists claim the boy is clearly a fraud, but to his followers he is the one they have been waiting for and now they flock to his banner as he begins his [ismaili.GetCrusadeName] to wrest the [ismaili_revolt_target_title.GetFullName] from the hands of [ismaili_revolt_target.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Now, however, they are mobilizing their strength behind [d_ismaili.GetRulerTitle] [ismaili_revolter.GetFirstName] -- descendant of Muhummad through his daughter, Fatimah, who has abdicated his title as the [abdicated_title.GetRulerTitle] of [abdicated_title.GetName] in order to lead his faithful against [ismaili_revolt_target.GetTitledFirstName] for control over the [ismaili_revolt_target_title.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1973;With your assumption of the [ismaili.GetFullNameName], [ismaili.GetName] faithful from across many realms have flocked to [Root.Capital.GetName] to fight under your banner.

EVTNAME_emf_heresy_1976;A New [ismaili.GetName] Claimant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1976;While the line descending directly from Isma'il, the Sixth [d_shiite.GetRulerTitle] of the [shiite.GetName]s, was thought to have been lost, a new claimant has arisen in the form of [Root.GetBestName]. While not a direct descendant, [Root.GetSheHe] is indeed a descendant of Fatimah and claims that is enough for [Root.GetHerHim] to carry the banner of the [ismaili.GetName]s. Many [ismaili.GetGroupName] scholars disagree, but there are a great many faithful who do and may one day flock to [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s banner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1977;For many years, the [ismaili.GetName] [ismaili.GetGroupName]s believed that their [d_ismaili.GetRulerTitle] was in occultation, but now [Root.GetFirstName] has claimed not only to be the descendant of Isma'il but with his successful conquest of [conquered_title.GetName] has declared himself the [Root.RelHead.GetTitle] as well. Many of the [ismaili.GetName]s support his claim, while others support a leader by the name of Hamdan al-Qarmat who claims [Root.GetTitledFirstName] to be but an imposter. These 'Qarmatians' claim no allegiance to the new [Root.RelHead.GetTitle], saying he must be torn down at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2001;The [cathar.GetName] Church frowns upon contact with members of the opposite sex.

At this council, the [cathar.GetPriestTitle]s codified many of their laws and spread territories into 'bishoprics', and they have since gained many followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The [Root.Religion.GetName]s believe, after all, that one of the way the [catholic.GetName] Church maintains control over the masses is by restricting those who can read it to those educated few versed in the ancient tongue of [latin.GetName]. A non-[latin.GetName] version of  [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] is, then, something of a revelation. Unfortunately for [Root.GetTitledFirstName], [Root.GetHerHis] new edition of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] is not only considered something of a poor translation -- with far too many parts obviously swayed by the politics of the day -- it is mostly mocked outside of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] faith and mostly disregarded. Even so, it is of great interest to many, and has aided the spread of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2018;We will keep working on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2020;The death of [From.GetTitledFirstName] means that [From.GetHerHis] efforts to translate  [From.Religion.GetScriptureName] into the vernacular have been put on hold. Not only that, they are in disarray, and it will take a fair amount of effort to continue the task. Alternatively, the plan could be stopped now, and at least some of the expense regained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2020;I will continue [From.GetHerHis] efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2021_wicked;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI understand you espouse the [Root.Religion.GetName] ideals... yet I see no evidence of that in your conduct.

Thus I hereby declare that your greater titles be claimed by the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2025;Brother Angelo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2025;A disgruntled [Root.Religion.GetName] monk by the name of Brother Angelo has heavily criticized [Root.GetTitledName], and in so doing has rocked the authority of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church. Brother Angelo denies that [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is legally the [Root.GetTitle], as [Root.GetSheHe] has abrogated the Rule of St. Francis -- which, according to his doctrine, represented the pure and simple Gospel. He has asserted that all of [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s decrees are thus invalid, and that all [Root.Religion.GetName]s who follow the [Root.GetTitle]'s will have lost the grace of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2025;The man is clearly a heretic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2025;He sounds like a man with the right ideas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_2025;Criticize the [Root.GetTitle]? Unheard of!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2027;The words of Brother Angelo have been weighing on your soul. Too many churchmen are more concerned more with power and money than with their holy calling, and the result is a [Root.Religion.GetName] Church that is rife with corruption. Perhaps the [fraticelli.GetName] are right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2027;I believe in their call for reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2027;Right or not, I will follow the Faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2030;A wealthy merchant of [poor_of_lyons.GetName] by the name of Pierre Valdes gave up all his earthly possessions and began wandering the countryside as a preacher after a brush with death. He has been condemning the [catholic.GetName] Church for its corruption, as well as calling for a return to a more Biblical lifestyle. The man has rapidly gained followers amongst the poor of [poor_of_lyons.GetName], and his disciples have ranged even further and begun seeking converts elsewhere -- enough to cause considerable concern within the [catholic.GetName] hierarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2030;The man is clearly a heretic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2030;And thus another heresy begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_2030;Another problem for the [catholic.GetName]s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2031;The founding of the [d_waldensian.GetFullName] was mostly underground, and the so the early initiates organized themselves into cells. The Doctores would lead the cells and train Novellani, who would go and preach to the masses, while the Sandaliati would travel to keep the cells in touch. It is a tradition that has continued to this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2031;I am Sandaliati.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2031;I am Doctores.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2032;As a [waldensian.GetName] [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], you are considered to have brought considerable renown to the cause.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2034;As your men storm the church, you cut down a [From.Owner.Religion.GetName] [From.Owner.Religion.GetPriestTitle] trying to protect a relic, gilded in gold. These false idols are a means to deceive the peasants and confuse ignorant fools. You are of half a mind to destroy them and return the wealth to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2034;Do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2034;I would rather keep it for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2035_rome;Rome, the Eternal City, and the source of all the corruption of the Church. It is full of treasures stolen from the people, false relics to deceive the gullible. Your men have their orders: destroy them all, and return the wealth to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2035_canterbury;Canterbury, where the tomb Thomas Beckett lies... or lied, since it is there no longer. The tomb has been destroyed by your holy wrath, no longer able to tempt poor Christian fools away from devoting their faith to false relics, and the wealth of its riches returned to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2035_santiago;You don't know who is buried in this shrine, but you know it is not St. James. That is just a false legend made to trick pilgrims and take their money.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2035_koln;In the Cathedral of Köln, there lies the Sarcophagus of the Magi: over two meters of gilded silver and jewels. Why waste such wealth on falsehoods, idols that lure the foolish away from their true faith in [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], when it could be given to the poor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2036_rome;After the [waldensian.GetName]s seized Rome, they proceeded to destroy any and all holy relics they could reach, stripping all the wealth from the Roman churches. The bones of St. Peter have been thrown out and cast into the street, the Chains of St. Paul melted down, and the Scala Santa smashed and destroyed. [waldensian.GetGroupName]s everywhere are distraught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2036_canterbury;Canterbury, the great pilgrimage site for all of the British Isles has been destroyed, the tomb of St. Thomas Beckett desecrated by the [waldensian.GetName]s. Even as the heretics rejoice at their victory, so are [waldensian.GetGroupName]s elsewhere distraught at the loss of the holy relics now cast aside as worthless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2036_santiago;The Way of St. James has no endpoint now, as Santiago de Compostela has fallen to the [waldensian.GetName]s. The shrine of St. James has been destroyed, the bones once therein now missing, and the many holy relics which belonged to the shrine have either been destroyed or cast to the people as trinkets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2036_koln;The Grand Cathedral of Köln now smoulders as the [waldensian.GetName]s strip it of everything of value. Countless relics have been destroyed, including the Sarcophagus of the Magi: over two meters of gilded silver and jewels, all melted down.

EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2036;A victory for sense and righteousness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2037;All [waldensian.GetName] lords are expect to give charity to the poor and disenfranchised in their realm. Now, that tenet is tested as a large number of refugees have arrived into [Root.Capital.GetName] from the provinces of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].

EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2037;They must be helped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2037;There is nothing to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2038;In the sermon today, your [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] expounded on the sin of greed, and how no greedy [Root.GetManWoman] can enter heaven. You just wish he didn't use yourself as an example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2039;A recent opportunity to improve the facilities in [Root.Capital.GetName] for assisting the poor has arisen, and it is something your councilors tell you will not only assist the people but make the city far better than it has ever been.

A prominent [heretic_relhead.Religion.GetName] ruler by the name of [sponsor.GetTitledName] has called for a conclave in [sponsor.Capital.GetName] where [heretic_relhead.GetTitledFirstName] and [parent_relhead.GetTitledFirstName] can meet and discuss whether a peaceful resolution of their differences is possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2075;We are hoping for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2075;Peace with the [heretic_relhead.Religion.GetName] heretics? Truly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2076;You arrive in [sponsor.Capital.GetName] and listen to [heretic_relhead.GetTitledFirstName] as [heretic_relhead.GetSheHe] goes on at length about the need for peace and the fundamental differences between the [heretic_relhead.Religion.GetName] and your own... but what it comes down to is this: will you let them go, undermining the strength of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith in doing so? If you don't, you will need to marshal the [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful in a [Root.Religion.GetCrusadeName] against them... and failing that war would be far worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2076;Agree to a peaceful resolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2076;Refuse and call for the [Root.Religion.GetCrusadeName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2077;In an unprecedented show of tolerance and diplomacy, [parent_relhead.GetTitledName] has agreed to a truce with [heretic_relhead.GetTitledName] and indeed the entire [heretic_relhead.Religion.GetName] faith after a historic meeting in [sponsor.Capital.GetName]. The [heretic_relhead.Religion.GetName]s will now be considered an offshoot of the [parent_relhead.Religion.GetName] religion, their differences a permanent schism, rather than a heresy which must be suppressed and stamped out. [heretic_relhead.Religion.GetName] faithful across all of Europe have risen up in celebration of this momentous day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2077;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2077;We must tolerate these [heretic_relhead.Religion.GetName]s now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_2077;A sign of [parent_relhead.Religion.GetName] weakness, clearly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_heresy_2077;This is all [heretic_relhead.Religion.GetGroupName] nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2078;A historic meeting in [sponsor.Capital.GetName] between [heretic_relhead.GetTitledFirstName] and [parent_relhead.GetTitledFirstName] has ended in disaster. It was clear from the outset that [parent_relhead.GetTitledFirstName] was ready to compromise on none of the [heretic_relhead.Religion.GetName] points of discussion, and eventually [parent_relhead.GetTitledFirstName] left the conclave in disgust. [parent_relhead.GetSheHeCap] shortly afterwards called for a holy war against the [heretic_relhead.Religion.GetName]s by all [parent_relhead.Religion.GetName] faithful to reclaim their souls for [parent_relhead.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2078;Did we truly expect any other result?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2078;So be it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2079;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI have called on all [From.Religion.GetName] faithful to rise up in arms against the wicked [heretic_relhead.Religion.GetName]s and strike down their most prominent leader: [sponsor.GetBestName].

EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2079;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2079;I shall consider it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2100;Acheiropoieta;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2100;Above the gate to a city in [acheiropoieta_province.GetName], there is enshrined an Acheiropoieta: an icon which, it is claimed, was not created by human hands but rather came into existence miraculously. All icons in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are condemned to be destroyed, but the people of [acheiropoieta_province.GetName] have refused to destroy the Acheiropoieta, claiming its divine heritage shelters the city from danger. [iconoclast_patriarch.GetTitledName] has, however, demanded you deal it regardless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2100;Send soldiers to destroy it immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2100;Let them have their false icon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_2100;Take it and keep it for yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2101;You still have the acheiropoieta you took so long ago from the city in [acheiropoieta_province.GetName]. You keep it in a secluded shrine that only you have access to. Lately, as you go to visit it, you hear voices in your head, telling you things, things confusing your mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2101;It really is divine! Icons are real!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2101;It is [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] trying to destroy me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2102;Constantine's Return;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2102;The war is not going well, and many parts of the empire are already in chaos. Now, a group of soldiers has reportedly broken into the imperial mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles, opened the sarcophagus of Constantine V, and implored him to return and save the empire. Iconoclast zealots have been quick to jump on this news, claiming it is [orthodox.GetName] idolatry that is dooming the emperor. They have pleaded with [Root.GetTitledFirstName] to honor the memory of the former emperor and lead the emperor away from its idolatrous ways before it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2102;They are right -- the idolatry must end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2102;That is not why we are losing the war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_2102;This does not bode well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2103;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has embraced the iconoclast heresy, demanding that all holy icons be destroyed and all subjects of the empire convert as [From.GetSheHe] has.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2103;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2103;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a fool and a heretic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_2103;Finally an [From.PrimaryTitle.GetTitledName] with sense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_heresy_2103;This is of no concern to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2105;[Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2105;While the [paulician.GetName] faith has been riven by internal conflicts for the last few decades, the heresy has a new leader in [Root.GetTitledFirstName], a zealous [paulician.GetPriestTitle] of [Root.Culture.GetName] origin as well as an effective converter. He has spread his sect throughout Armenian lands ruled by the [e_byzantium.GetFullName], and is very quickly becoming a major problem for [orthodox.GetName] rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2105;Blasted heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2106;All across the Byzantine Empire, [paulician.GetName]s are being violently persecuted on the order of [Root.GetTitledName]. They are rounded up and imprisoned, their homes burned and their belongings seized. All [paulician.GetName] courtiers have been ordered either executed or banished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2106;Hopefully that will take care of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2106;A rather extreme measure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_2106;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2107;The [paulician.GetName] [d_paulician.GetRulerTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2107;[Root.GetTitledName] has claimed the title of [paulician.GetName] [d_paulician.GetRulerTitle], head of all [paulician.GetGroupName]s who follow the teachings of Paul of Samosata. Others outside of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] claim the [Root.GetManWoman] is little more than a glorified warlord, but to the [paulician.GetName] faithful [Root.GetSheHe] is a symbol of their victory against attempts by their fellow [paulician.GetGroupName]s to suppress them. Perhaps, in time, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] will lead the [paulician.GetName]s to claiming a piece of history in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2107;A glorious day for us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2107;Who is this upstart heretic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_2107;A self-titled warmonger? How very [paulician.GetGroupName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2110;[bogomilist.GetName]s in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2110;A heresiarch by the name of 'Bogomil', which may not even be his true name, has appeared in the province of Kossovo, capitalizing on the anger of the locals following their conversion from pagan ways. His teachings of a heresy that seems to combine the [bogomilist.GetGroupName] faith with a combination of Gnostic dualism and anti-church sentiment has caught on extremely quickly in both Kossovo and the surrounding areas, presenting a challenge to [Root.GetTitledName]'s rule as well as to the authority of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Some believe that this 'Bogomil' has reached the court of [Root.GetTitledFirstName], and that [Root.GetSheHe] might even be considered a conversion to these heretical beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2110;I believe this priest has wise things to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2110;Me, convert? To a foul heresy?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_2110;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_heresy_2110;This does not bode well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2112;The formalization process of the [bogomilist.GetName] faith has officially begun, with [Root.GetTitledFirstName] meeting with a group of perfecti leaders in [Root.Capital.GetName] and expressing [Root.GetHerHis] desire to see the faith go from a disorganized movement to one fully integrated with [Root.GetHerHis] rule. They expressed doubt, but were willing to hear [Root.GetHerHim] out, for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2112;We will all have to be patient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2113_religion;All this talk of 'reforming' the [bogomilist.GetName] faith in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is pointless. Perhaps the previous rulers were interested in such a thing, but since you are not a [bogomilist.GetName], you will certainly have no part in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2113_rule;While you would gladly continue the process of reforming the [bogomilist.GetName] faith, you no longer have the influence to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2114;[Root.GetTitledName]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the [bogomilist.GetName] faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have been rewarded after a recent meeting of Perfecti in [Root.Capital.GetName]. They finally agreed to a common liturgy, so that ceremonies performed across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] use a common set of prayers and rituals, and that this will be taught to new Perfecti going forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2115;Up until now, [bogomilist.GetName] priests have all used different letters and gospels in their preaching, a result of the scattered and disparate beginnings of the faith. At the behest of [Root.GetTitledName], '[bogomilist.GetScriptureNameCap] of [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName]' has been written and agred upon as canon by a council of Perfecti in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2116;In order to continue the process of formalizing the [bogomilist.GetName] faith, the scattered preachers and Perfecti will need to be gathered together in councils. They resist such efforts an organization, however, and the only way to see it done will be with coin -- for the poor, for shrines, for bribes, and for [bogomilist.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2116;If that is what it takes, so be it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2116;I will not bribe my faith into reform!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2117;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the [bogomilist.GetName] faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have been rewarded after an unprecedented agreement from [bogomilist.GetName] leaders across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to gather in permanent councils sponsored by the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2117;A good day for all [bogomilist.GetName]s!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2118;A [bogomilist.GetName] Perfecti has approached you with an idea for continuing your efforts to formalize your faith: the construction of several seminary schools across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], each teaching a common and unified version of [bogomilist.GetName] dogma to future preachers. It would be expensive, but the Perfecti says it would be a worthy achievement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2118;An excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2118;Not right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2119;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the [bogomilist.GetName] faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have advanced, with the construction of numerous seminary schools across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] that would each train new [bogomilist.GetPriestTitle]s in a standardized form of dogma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2120;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the [bogomilist.GetName] faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have been rewarded today after a prominent Perfecti in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] issued a proclamation of support. The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] is a [Root.GetManWoman] of [bogomilist.GetHighGodName] and faith, he says, and thus [Root.GetHerHis] desires should be heeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2121;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the [bogomilist.GetName] faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have advanced after the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] gave a speech in [Root.Capital.GetName] that has been widely-disseminated and complimented by pious scholars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2122;A recent treatise written by [Root.GetTitledName] [Root.GetHerHim]self on the vital importance of the [bogomilist.GetName] faith's continued reforms has spread far and wide across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and received a lot of recognition from the faithful as being full of wisdom. Indeed, some are viewing the text as a new addition to [bogomilist.GetName] canon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2123;Recently, a new sect of [bogomilist.GetName] has been spreading in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], one that advocates a radically different version of the faith. Normally this would not be an issue, as the sect is not popular, but it has proven disruptive to your efforts to formalize the [bogomilist.GetName] faith, as their presence has prompted other sects to follow suit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2123;Leave them be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2123;Quietly get rid of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2124;A recent revival of [bogomilist.GetName] traditionalism has taken hold in [PrimaryTitle.GetName], with numerous preachers cropping up who actively deride your efforts to reform the faith as being exactly the same sort of tyrannical structure they rebelled against in the first place. Needless to say, this has not been helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2125;A prominent Perfecti in [demand_province.GetName] has publicly begged that you slow down, if not outright stop, the process of [bogomilist.GetName] reform. The common folk are confused by these contradictions, he says, and continuing down this path too quickly will only bring down [bogomilist.GetHighGodName]'s wrath. The Perfecti is too popular to be silenced, as doing so would turn him into a martyr for his cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2125;Do as he asks, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2125;Ignore him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2126;A set of crop failures and other disasters that has fallen one of your provinces in recent months has stirred the ire of several fiery preaches in the area. They say that you are to blame, that your desire for reforms and general lack of piety is what has brought down [bogomilist.GetHighGodName]'s wrath upon the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Sadly, their words have taken hold amongst many.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2127;A prominent Perfecti has recently taken issue with your desire to reform the [bogomilist.GetName] faith, pointing out a number of flaws in your argument without ever actually saying outright that your intention is solely to grab power and force the faithful into compliance. To her, you are not a learned enough [Root.GetManWoman] to push such things forward, and there is no convincing her otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2128;[Root.GetTitledName]'s recent victory against [From.GetTitledName] in [Root.Location.GetName] has been hailed as a major victory for the [bogomilist.GetName] faith, and has spread the notion that perhaps the continuing reforms of the faith have [bogomilist.GetHighGodName]'s favor after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2129;[Root.GetTitledName]'s recent staggering loss against [From.GetTitledName] in [Root.Location.GetName] has been hailed as a sign that the ongoing reforms of the [bogomilist.GetName] faith do not have [bogomilist.GetHighGodName]'s favor after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2130;[bogomilist.GetName] Faith Organized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2130;In its inception, the [bogomilist.GetName] faith was only loosely organized. It didn't believe in formal [Root.GetHouseOfWorship]s, and opposed any kind of formal hierarchy -- this has all changed with the leadership of [Root.GetTitledName], whose [bogomilist.GetPietyName] and status as a Perfecti has encouraged all members of [Root.GetHerHis] faith to reconsider their resistance to feudal structures. [bogomilist.GetName]s across the world are now more formally organized, though many still do not consider them a true religion, and they remain opposed to any kind of formal church that emulates the [orthodox.GetName] priesthood. Even so, there are many that object to even these changes, saying that the [bogomilist.GetName] faith has betrayed its own roots at a powerful [Root.GetLordLady]'s behest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2130;A better day for us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2131;[bogomilist.GetName] Faith Formalized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2131;Though the faithful were hardly ready for it, the [bogomilist.GetName] faith has now been formalized as a structured religion thanks to the leadership of [Root.GetTitledName]. While many see [Root.GetHerHis] leadership and [bogomilist.GetPietyName] as being worthwhile to follow, there are many who claim [Root.GetSheHe] has dragged the faith too fast into something which too much resembles the very kind of tyrannical structures they once abandoned. Preachers throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are questioning how far this will go, and whether the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] has not perhaps betrayed the [bogomilist.GetName] faith's principles for the sake of power. Whatever the case, [bogomilist.GetName] [bogomilist.GetPriestTitle]s are now unified under a common liturgy, a single sacred text, and operate out of [Root.GetHouseOfWorship]s -- far more than the disparate heretics from where they sprang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2131;This is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2131;Are we truly ready for this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2132;After a long and arduous process of reform, the [bogomilist.GetName] faith can now truly be considered a formal religion. Under the considered leadership and [bogomilist.GetPietyName] of [Root.GetTitledName], [bogomilist.GetName] priests are now unified under a common liturgy, a single sacred text, and operate out of temples -- far more than the disparate heretics from where they sprang. While some question whether these reforms betray the principles upon which the [bogomilist.GetName] faith was founded, far more say they were agreed to by all and with due consideration. The faith is now ready to come into its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_emf_heresy_2134;The [bogomilist.GetName] Patriarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2134;At the behest of [Root.GetTitledName], [new_bogomilist_patriarch.GetTitledName] has been elected as the head of the newly-founded [d_bogomilist.GetFullName], the [bogomilist.GetName] faith having completely transformed itself from an [orthodox.GetName] heresy into a fully-formed religion in its own right. [bogomilist.GetGroupName] leaders elsewhere have been forced to recognize this new faith as a force in its own right, and its inception as a schism from the standard [bogomilist.GetGroupName] faith rather than a true heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2134;It appears we must accept this now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_2134;Heretics or not, they are still [bogomilist.GetGroupName]s!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2135;Construction has begun in Tyrnovo on the planned [Root.GetHouseOfWorshipCap] of St. Bogomil, a structure to rival St. Peter's Basilica or the Hagia Sophia. It will surely be a marvel of construction, and a bastion of faith for all [bogomilist.GetName]s across the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2137;The [Root.GetHouseOfWorshipCap] of St. Bogomil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2137;As evidence of just how far the [bogomilist.GetName] faith has come, the [Root.GetHouseOfWorshipCap] of St. Bogomil has completed construction in the city of Tyrnovo. A majestic structure to rival even the most potent [bogomilist.GetGroupName] cathedrals, the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] has become a bastion of faith for all [bogomilist.GetName]s across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The faithful line the streets, listening to the hymns sung in the cathedral, and rejoice when the declaration is finally made: the [new_saint.GetManWoman] once known as [new_saint.GetTitledFirstName] will now and forever more be known as Saint [new_saint.GetFirstNameWithNick].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2605_relhead;In an elaborate ceremony conducted by [religion_head_title.Holder.GetTitledName], the late [new_saint.GetTitledFirstName] has been formally recognized for [new_saint.GetHerHis] leadership of the [new_saint.Religion.GetName] faithful as a true example of a [new_saint.Religion.GetGroupName], and thus has been declared a [new_saint.Religion.GetName] saint. The faithful line the streets, listening to the hymns sung in the cathedral, and rejoice when the declaration is finally made: the [new_saint.GetManWoman] once known as [new_saint.GetTitledFirstName] will now and forever more be known as Saint [new_saint.GetFirstNameWithNick].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2605;Glory to [new_saint.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2610;The path to becoming a paragon of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is a difficult one, and will likely take years of dedication and patience before it is rewarded -- if, indeed, it is rewarded at all. There will be many setbacks along the way, and the purification of one's soul does not come without trial, but the truly faithful could perhaps see it through to the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2610;I shall persevere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2611;With your wealth, it would not be difficult to build a [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] in [Root.Location.GetName], and the clergy would be very grateful. It would go a long way to showing your dedication to [Root.Religion.GetPietyName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2611;Yes, that's a wonderful idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2611;No, there are enough [Root.GetHouseOfWorship]es.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2612;The recent outbreak of a sickness in [Root.Location.GetName] brings to mind tales of saints who administered to the sick, doing whatever they can for the poor and helpless. Your advisors are alarmed, however, expressing their worry that exposing yourself to such illness is a very bad idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2612;Of course I will help the sick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2612;They are right -- it's too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2613;Perhaps having heard of your efforts to treat the sick, a man riddled with disease has come to [Root.Location.GetName] asking that you lay on hands and pray to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] that he be cured. One so faithful as yourself, he claims, is his best and only hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2613;I will touch him and pray.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2613;No, healing doesn't work that way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2614;You've heard rumors of a wise ascetic monk living in a remote part of [Root.Location.GetName]. Perhaps if you undertake a journey to visit the man, he could impart his wisdom upon you. It would be a difficult voyage, however, far more so since you feel you must go it alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2614;I will go at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2614;No, it's not worth the risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2615;True dedication to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith can not be done from a throne. If you are to be truly saintly, you must retreat to a monastery and take vows to serve [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and only Him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2615;I will live my life in the service of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2615;No, I am meant for better things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2616;There are whispers in your court that one who has so much wealth cannot truly be considered humble or charitable, and that such dedication to the material world is hardly the sign of the saintly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2616;Wealth is unimportant to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2616;What should I do? Give it all away?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2617;During your recent bout of illness, one of your maids is shocked to discover your hands bleeding -- as if you were suffering from the same wounds Jesus Christ suffered upon the cross. There is no evidence of the stigmata later, but the maid's tale has spread throughout [Root.Location.GetName] and many seem to believe it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2617;Perhaps I am truly blessed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2618;You hear that [supporting_priest.GetBestName] has declared [supporting_priest.GetHerHis] support for your quest to attain saintly status. [supporting_priest.GetHerHisCap] last sermon was dedicated to lauding your virtues, and suggesting the [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful should emulate you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2619;You hear that [doubting_priest.GetBestName] has been openly doubting your quest for saintly status, suggesting it is proud that motivates you and not true dedication to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. The only thing that could possibly persuade [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] is to present yourself for testing -- but would it be performed fairly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2619;Allow [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] to test me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2619;Let [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] doubt -- I do not care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2620;After a thorough questioning, [doubting_priest.GetTitledFirstName] is clearly convinced of your [Root.Religion.GetPietyName] and that your quest for sainthood is genuine. [doubting_priest.GetSheHeCap] begs your forgiveness, and suggests [doubting_priest.GetSheHe] will do whatever [doubting_priest.GetSheHe] can to help you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2621;After a thorough questioning, [doubting_priest.GetTitledFirstName] declares that you are no paragon of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and certainly no living saint. You are almost certain [doubting_priest.GetSheHe] had decided the outcome long before meeting you, and nothing you said could have persuaded [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2621;Which of us truly lacks faith, I wonder?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2622;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your extreme [Root.Religion.GetPietyName] and dedication to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Your name is constantly on the lips of the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s during their sermons, as they hold you up as an example to others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2623;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your dedication to knowledge and learning. You are a true [Root.Religion.GetName] scholar, they say, and the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s hold you up as an example to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2624;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your charisma and dedication to diplomacy. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] has bestowed upon you a light that others admire, they say, and the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s hold you up as an example to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2625;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your martial prowess against the infidels. You are a true [Root.Religion.GetName] warrior, they say, and the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s hold you up as an example to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2626;Your base lusts run contrary to everything a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should possess, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer them. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2626;I shall make the attempt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_religion_2626;No, this isn't worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2627;Your gluttonous nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2628;Your greedy nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2629;Your slothful nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2630;Your envious nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2631;Your cruel nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2632;Your wrathful nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2633;Pride is the deadliest sin, as it is the source of all others. If you truly aspire to be a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, you will need to conquer this belief that you deserve more than others. You must prostrate yourself before [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and take what judgement He decrees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2634;Your deceitful nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2635;You will never truly be a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith until you conquer your ambition. It comes from a sense of pride, at seeking to raise yourself above others rather than to accept what [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] has given you. To forget one's ambitions, however, is not an easy task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2636;Your arbitrary sense of justice runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_lustful;For weeks you have tried to forget your lusts, to focus on chasteful thoughts and nothing else... but it has been no use. Not thinking such things leads to thinking of little else, until you are nearly mad from the attempt. You are cursed, and it seems nothing you do will change it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_gluttonous;For weeks you have nearly starved yourself, attempting to force yourself to be temperate as a good [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetManWoman] ought to be... but it is no use. After a late-night binge in the kitchens, you have to admit that your will has been defeated by your appetite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_greedy;For weeks you have been trying to be charitable, giving coins away to those in need and considering what possessions you ought to offer as gifts. Each time, however, thoughts of what you have lost dominate your mind until it nearly drives you mad. The last time a beggar asked for alms you kicked him. Sadly, it is no use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_slothful;For weeks you have tried to be diligent, forcing yourself to attend to every important duty no matter how minor. It has done nothing but make you irritable, and you slowly find yourself making every excuse to do anything else. All you want to do now is sleep, and forget you ever wanted to be saintly. It's so much work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_envious;For weeks you have tried to be kind, forcing yourself to think well of others and not envy the things they have which you do not. It is all just a facade, however. The spite built up inside until you lashed out at everyone who crossed your path, and now you just feel awful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_cruel;For weeks you have tried to be gentle and kind to everyone who crossed your path. Your edicts have been merciful, your sentences have been brief... but it's no use. It's as if not thinking cruel thoughts has made them ALL you can focus on. You need some time in the dungeons before you truly go mad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_wroth;For weeks you have tried to control your temper. You have been patient with everyone, so patient that your courtiers frequently marvel at this change of heart. But you despise them for admiring what you know are false words. After beating a page near to death for spilling your wine, you have to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_proud;For weeks you have tried to show humility. You have complimented those who didn't truly deserve it, gave others an opportunity to act even when you knew better, tried not to be angry when things didn't go your way... but it's no use. You don't feel any different. Indeed, perhaps you're not sure *how* not to be proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_deceitful;For weeks you have tried to be scrupulously honest, even regarding things that one really shouldn't be honest about. You heart isn't truly in it, however, and sometimes you find yourself winding your way around the truth like a snake. It's time to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_ambitious;For weeks you have done nothing... almost literally. You've made no plans, made no attempts to work towards your goals, and indeed have tried to forget about your goals completely. Being content just feels so unnatural, however. You can't push the ambitions from your mind, and finally have to admit defeat. It isn't working.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2637_arbitrary;For weeks you have tried to be just in the way everyone expects. You've made every attempt to care about what's right and what's wrong, listened to your advisors, but it just seems so... pointless. You don't think you truly have a sense of justice, no matter how much you try. It's time to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2637;I will try again -- I must!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_lustful;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and your duties, attempting to put all lustful thoughts aside... and, to your surprise, it has worked. Perhaps whatever needs such thoughts served has been replaced by your love of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. Whatever the case, you now feel you can move forward, pure in deed as well as mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_gluttonous;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and temperance, eating lightly and avoiding excess... and, to your surprise, it has worked. Your appetite has been replaced by a love of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and, while you may never be truly temperate, you can at least rest assured your gluttonous nature has been defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_greedy;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and charity... and, to your surprise, it has worked. Giving to others actually feels *good*. You never thought it would, really. No-one will ever accuse you of being truly charitable, but your overwhelming desire to accumulate things for yourself seems to have passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_slothful;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and your duties... and, to your surprise, it has worked. You have never felt so alive and full of energy. Granted, it's difficult and you are exhausted all the time, but you look back on the way you were and can only shake your head at all the years wasted doing nothing useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_envious;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and kind thoughts... and, to your surprise, it has worked. All the spite you used to feel just seems to take so much *energy*, you now can't imagine why you did it. Nobody will accuse you of being kind, perhaps, but a little of your love of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] has now spread to others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_cruel;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and kind deeds... and, to your surprise, it has worked. Cruelty does not come quite so quickly as it used to, and it shocks you how good it feels to be generous from time to time. Perhaps such dark thoughts simply cannot survive in the light of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_wroth;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and patience... and, to your surprise, it has worked. There have been no bouts of rage, no lashing out at anyone. When your old temper begins to rise, you think of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and it all seems to... melt away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_proud;Humility does not come easy. For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer, and to thinking of others before yourself. To your surprise, doing so feels good. The way they smile is a reward in and of itself, even if you get nothing else out of it. Perhaps this is what [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s love truly means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_deceitful;For weeks you have been nothing but scrupulously honest, dedicating yourself to prayer and avoiding twisty thoughts of intrigue. To your surprise, it has worked. It has become easier and easier just to speak your heart, and you find yourself regretting the fact you ever felt the need to deceive others at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_ambitious;Putting aside your ambitions has not been easy. For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and made no plans, and for a while it made you mad to feel so idle... and then, one morning, you just let it go. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] shall provide, or shall not. Perhaps it truly is that simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2638_arbitrary;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer, and to dealing with supplicants in the fairest manner possible. It all seemed like such pointless work, and so aggravating, until one day you realize right and wrong isn't so complicated. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s love is justice, and knowing that makes it so much easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2638;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] has given me a gift, and I shall not squander it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2639;There are those who question your mystic pursuits, wondering whether this is the act of a pious [Root.GetManWoman] of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] or the dabblings of a pagan. You insist that it is the former, but perhaps not everyone will see it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2639;Am I not a good [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2640;There are those who question your more... violent... interests, wondering whether these are the efforts of a zealous [Root.GetManWoman] of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] or the darker urges of a criminal. You insist that it is the former, but perhaps not everyone will see it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2640;I do what I do for [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2641;As you continue your search for [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and saintly status, your chaste nature becomes better-known to those around you. [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitleCap]s in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] mention you in their sermons, saying that others should take their example from you and put aside their own lustful thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2641;All should strive for virtue;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2642;As you continue your search for [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and saintly status, your vow of celibacy becomes better-known to those around you.

EVTDESC_emf_religion_2643;As you continue your search for [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and saintly status, your charitable nature becomes better-known to those around you.

EVTDESC_emf_religion_2644;As you continue your search for [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and saintly status, your kind nature becomes better-known to those around you. The people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] consider you a generous ruler, untouched by the harsh world, and an example to others who seem to know only hate and cruelty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2645;As you continue your search for [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and saintly status, your humility becomes better-known to those around you. [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitleCap]s in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] mention you in their sermons, saying that others should take their example from you and put aside their own pride and concern for only themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2646;As you continue your search for [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and saintly status, your honest nature becomes better-known to those around you. Indeed, you recently told the truth to a visiting courtier when a lie would have served you far better... and the man was so impressed he told the tale far and wide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2647;As you continue your search for [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and saintly status, your sense of justice becomes better-known to those around you. The people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] consider you a fair and wise ruler, trusting your edicts like they would almost no other, and an example to selfish rulers elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2648;As you continue your search for [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and saintly status, your devotion to theology has gained you a great deal of admiration. '[Root.GetTitledFirstName] is a true [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] scholar,' they say, and many eagerly await copies of your studies on [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and true faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2649;There are those who have questioned the voice you claim to hear, suggesting it is not Jesus but a demon, or worse. Now it seems that tide has turned, and more people in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are realizing that perhaps you do have a connection to the Divine, that you have been touched by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] Himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2649;Jesus shall guide them, as he does me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2650;Through constant prayer and dedication to virtue, all the stress you feel has started to... simply melt away. Perhaps this is the peace a simpler life entails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2650;I shall renew my dedication to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2651;It has taken time, but your devotion to prayer and virtue has lifted the dark clouds from your thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2652;You have come to realize that your devotion to drink is, in itself, a form of gluttony that simply cannot be abided. The time for abstinence has come, as difficult as it will be on your system after so many years of excess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2653;You have devoted yourself for so long to your pursuit of saintly virtue, sometimes it feels as if you make almost no progress at all. But you are getting there, slow as the path might be. You can feel yourself drawing closer to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] with each passing day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2653;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] forgive me my impatience!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2654;It seems as if you have been walking the path to saintly virtue forever. Can it really be achieved, or is it all some lie peddled by the priests to the gullible? Doubt besets you, and you feel your resolve slipping despite your continued dedication to prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2654;I will not give up! I must not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2655_fail1;It is too much. Setback after setback has beset you, and it seems more and more unlikely you will ever achieve saintly virtue as you desire. It pains you to admit, but the time has come to give up on your ambition -- you are simply not the [Root.GetManWoman] of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] you'd hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2655_fail2;You have literally spent years on the path to saintly virtue, but you admit to yourself there are still flaws in your character that cannot be ignored.

EVTOPTA_emf_religion_2655;I simply cannot do it any longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_religion_2656;You have spent years upon the path to saintly virtue, years spent banishing your inner demons and focusing exclusively on prayer and devotion to duty.
