emf_magyar_invasion_desc;It is time to leave the Etelköz behind and cross the Carpathian Mountains with our people, though doing so will require a fight. If we are successful, we will lose all our lands outside of the Kingdom of Pannonia -- but we will have a horde of sufficient power to establish a new realm in the west.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tb_emf_magyar_desc;For years, the Magyar clans have been torn apart by internal wars and strife. Many believe this has left the clans weakened, and while there is hope for eventual recovery, some believe it will be too late and that the clans are in a state which has left them weak to attack from neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# MAGYARS DECISIONS/EVENTS

emf_begin_magyar_migration;Cross the Carpathians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_begin_magyar_migration_desc;It has been evident for some time that our enemies here in the Etelköz are too many. Magyar elders are saying that the time has come for one final migration - this time across the western mountains and into the plains of the Carpathian basin. If the clans are united in this, we will form a horde which will be almost unstoppable by the soft western Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20225;With the loot gained from the raid, those recruits who came from the provinces have returned to their homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA20225;Until next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_magyar_3001;Over the past several months, the Magyar clans have been slowly crossing the mountains...and now have all but taken over our lands in the Carpathian basin. The horde they've formed is impressive, constituting their entire people uprooted from their former lands to the east. It's clear they intend to remain where they've settled. Fighting them, if that's what we choose to do, will not be easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_magyar_3001;Leave them be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_magyar_3001;Fight them! Drive them off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_magyar_3002;Now we move. The Magyar clans collect their people, and as a group we march across the mountains and leave our old lands in the Etelköz behind. Not everyone has come with us, but most...and, as a new horde, we shall take our chances in the west. We shall build new homes on the plains and strike terror in the hearts of Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_magyar_3002;The time of Magyar rule has come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_magyar_3005;The Magyar Migration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_magyar_3005;Facing enemies from all sides in their former homeland to the east, the pagan Magyar clans have gathered their people into a single terrifying horde and crossed the Carpathian Mountains to resettle in the plains. Many rulers are already nervous what the appearance of this horde means, and whether these renowned warriors will begin raiding further west than ever before or whether their strength will be broken at the hands of some stronger enemy willing to challenge them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_magyar_3006;Reports from [Root.GetName] indicate the Magyar people there have responded to the call from [From.GetTitledFirstName] and joined the horde migrating westward across the mountains. They have left behind their homes, their farms...everything, all in the hopes of establishing a new Magyar homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_magyar_3006;They are fools, clearly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_magyar_3013;My liege,\nWhen we left the Etelköz, the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] clan gave up its ancestral lands with the promise we would find new homes across the mountains. Now we are here, and you have bountiful lands under your control, and thus I ask that you grant us the [requested_title.GetFullName] to establish a new future for my family.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_magyar_3013;Yes, I remember the promise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_magyar_3013;Refuse - that land is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_magyar_3014;Ever since the Magyar clans arrived in [Root.GetName], our people have gotten along well with the Avar locals. They have adopted our language and customs far more quickly than we might have hoped. Perhaps this is a sign that our coming was a good decision after all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_magyar_3015;The Magyars were not alone when they crossed the mountains: with them came a number of Khazar clans who had split off from their own rulers further east. Many of those Khazars settled in [Root.GetName], mixing with both the Magyars and the locals to form a new people known as the Székely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_magyar_3020;Since the time we crossed the mountains into this new and fertile land, we Magyars dreamed of a time when we would rule the vast plains as we once did long ago far to the east. That time has now come. ALl of Carpathia is now under our domination, and the lords of the West have learned to fear us as they should.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_magyar_3022;The Conversion of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_magyar_3022;Word has reached the world that [Root.GetName] has agreed to convert to the Catholic faith, with both [Root.GetSheHe] and [Root.GetHerHis] family being baptised at the cathedral in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Since the time the Magyar clans crossed the mountains into Carpathia, their raiders have plagued western lands. Has this finally come to an end now that their ruler has embraced the word of God? Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_magyar_3022;Praise be to God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_magyar_3022;It will surely not last;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_magyar_3022;I will join [Root.GetHerHim] in this new faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_magyar_3022;[Root.GetSheHeCap] is clearly lost to the truth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
