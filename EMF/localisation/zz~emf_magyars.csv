If we are successful, we will lose all our lands outside of the Kingdom of Pannonia -- but we will have a horde of sufficient power to establish a new realm in the west.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

emf_begin_magyar_migration_desc;It has been evident for some time that our enemies here in the Etelköz are too many. Magyar elders are saying that the time has come for one last migration - this time across the western mountains and into the plains of the Carpathian basin. If the clans are united in this, we will form a horde which will be almost unstoppable by the soft western Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_3002;Now we move. The Magyar clans collect their people, and as a group we march across the mountains and leave our old lands in the Etelköz behind. Not everyone has come with us, but most...and, as a new horde, we shall take our chances in the west. We shall build new homes on the plains and strike terror in the hearts of Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_3002;The time of Magyar rule has come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_adventurer_3005;The Magyar Migration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_3005;Facing enemies from all sides in their former homeland to the east, the pagan Magyar clans have gathered their people into a single terrifying horde and crossed the Carpathian Mountains to resettle in the plains. Many rulers are already nervous what the appearance of this horde means, and whether these renowned warriors will begin raiding further west than ever before or whether their strength will be broken at the hands of some stronger enemy willing to challenge them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
