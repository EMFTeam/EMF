emf_startup.1.desc;EMF promotes a fun, varied, strategic, challenging, balanced, customizable, and, most importantly, coherent and seamless CKII experience. The EMF aesthetic makes you feel like you're playing the game CKII was supposed to be.\n\nWe strive to bring dynamism to your games within a historical context derived from an accurate, comprehensive, and quality-driven approach to game design, scripting, and historical research.\n\nDiscuss history, the game, and more with us in Paradox's HIP forum or on the HIP Community Discord server. The creator of EMF, zijistark, also leads HIP. Contact him if you're interested in contributing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
