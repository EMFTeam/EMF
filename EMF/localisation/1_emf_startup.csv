emf_startup.1.title;Extended Mechanics & Flavor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_startup.1.desc;EMF promotes a fun, varied, strategic, challenging, balanced, customizable, and, most importantly, coherent and seamless CKII experience. The EMF aesthetic makes you feel like you're playing the game CKII was supposed to be.\n\nWe strive to bring dynamism to your games within a historical context derived from an accurate, comprehensive, and quality-driven approach to game design, scripting, and historical research.\n\nDiscuss history, the game, and more with us in Paradox's HIP forum or on the HIP Community Discord server. The creator of EMF, zijistark, also leads HIP. Contact him if you're interested in contributing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

emf_startup.2.title;Error Initializing Campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_startup.2.desc;You have an installation error which is almost certainly caused by improper interaction between another mod and EMF. As such, the EMF campaign initialization sequence could NOT execute. Specifically, the global flag "EMF" was already set before the EMF campaign startup event could run, which would break countless things. Try disabling all other mods, and if that doesn't work, report this to the EMF / HIP team.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_startup.2.opt.a;That's unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
