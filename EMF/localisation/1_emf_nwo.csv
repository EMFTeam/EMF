emf_nwo.1.desc;With this scenario customization, you can change the face of the map in myriad ways, from dismantling the Christian empires and adding lots of new kingdoms with which to politick to shattering the world into independent counts and using rapid conquest CBs to etch your own new world order (and more).\n\nFirst, select independent counts, de jure dukes, or de jure kings mode. Among a variety of mostly self-explanatory options, you'll be asked whether to apply the new world order to the whole map, only Catholics, only Christians, or only Muslims.\n\nNote that you can take this customization decision again with different selections to get more complex results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

emf_nwo.11.desc;Would you like to enable certain rapid conquest CBs for faster conglomeration of the New World Order? The special CBs stop being valid once rulers' realm's grow beyond a certain size/tier, so the world will naturally cool-down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
