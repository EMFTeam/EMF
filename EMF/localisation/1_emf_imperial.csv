EVTOPTC_emf_coronation_1215;I bet the ceremony was nice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1216;With the coronation ceremony finished, the newly-anointed [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] retired to [From.GetHerHis] castle for the celebration feast. The hall is packed with people: the lords and ladies of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], their wives and husbands, visiting [From.Religion.GetName] rulers and emissaries...it will be a night to remember!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1216;Let the festivities commence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1216;This will be quite the celebration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1217;The coronation feast goes well into the night, and you find yourself frequently spending time with your host, drinking wine and laughing over stories. You leave feeling as if the two of you have gained an excellent understanding of one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1217;I've found a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1218;As the coronation feast continues, you find yourself frequently in the company of [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], drinking wine and laughing over stories. While you would not have thought so initially, it seems as if the two of you have gained an excellent understanding of one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1219;It was bound to happen. You drank a little too much at the coronation feast, and when you ran into your host you argued over the [argue_title.GetFullName] - which they hold, and which you believe rightfully belongs to you. Heated words were exchanged, to the point where guards had to politely separate the two of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1219;This is not my fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1220;It was bound to happen. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] drank too much at the coronation feast, and at one point in the night confronted you. [From.GetHerHisCap] words slurred from drink, [From.GetSheHe] argued with you over the [argue_title.GetFullName] - which you hold, but which [From.GetSheHe] believes rightfully belongs to [From.GetHerHim]. It caused quite the scene, reaching the point where guards had to politely separate the two of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1220;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1222;You suspected that [challenge_target.GetSheHe] might be at the coronation feast, and sure enough...there [challenge_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is, laughing and carrying on. You despise the man, and with a few drinks in you, it occurs to you to challenge him to a duel right here and now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1224;You challenged [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], but [From.GetSheHe] spluttered excuses regarding how this was a feast and you are both guests and so forth...and declined the challenge, much to his embarrassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1224;The coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1225;A series of shouts arose during the coronation feast, and the guests parted to reveal the culprits: [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] with blade drawn, challenging [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to a duel. Both men are ready to fight, and are asking for your leave to settle matters here and now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1225;Absolutely not! This is a feast, not a tavern!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1225;Talk them out of the foolish idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_coronation_1225;Why not? Some entertainment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1226;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] was furious at both of us for daring to ask to duel, all but ordering us out of the feast. We left, more bitter at [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] than at each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1226;[From.GetSheHeCap] had no right to speak to me in that fashion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1227;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] listened to our request to fight, and instead of agreeing took us each aside in turn and spoke to us calmly. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that it would be unfortunate if either of us were hurt, as it would be a breach of hospitality, and begged us to reconsider...and [From.GetSheHe] was right. It was a foolish idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1227;Another time, then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1228;Those at the coronation feast gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledName], overseen by [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [From.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] was stabbed by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and died!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1228;Most unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1228;The bastard killed me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_coronation_1228;Ha! [From.GetSheHe] had it coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_coronation_1228;How scandalous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1229;Those at the coronation feast gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.GetTitledName], overseen by [coronation_duel_host.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [coronation_duel_host.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] lost the duel and was badly wounded. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1229;There, it is done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1229;[From.GetSheHe] must have cheated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_coronation_1229;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] conceded defeat after first blood. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1231;Those at the coronation feast gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.GetTitledName], overseen by [coronation_duel_host.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [coronation_duel_host.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] was stabbed by [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and died!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1232;The coronation feast was going so well...and then you saw [Spouse.GetFirstName]'s lover, there across the room, laughing and as brazen as [Root.GetSheHe] pleased. How could [Spouse.GetSheHe] invite [Root.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1232;[Spouse.GetSheHeCap] does this to spite me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1233;The coronation feast was going so well...and then you saw [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] staring daggers at you. [From.GetSheHeCap] accosted you in front of your guests, making a scene over the fact your lover was present at the coronation! Eventually [From.GetSheHe] stormed off, but it was an embarrassing moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1233;That could have gone...better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1234;The coronation's festivities are going well...so well, in fact, that the muse has overtaken you. Perhaps an ode to your host, publicly declared for all to hear?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1234;Yes! Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1234;No, I couldn't bear the shame;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1235;At one point in the coronation's festivities, [From.GetTitledName] stands and gets everyone's attention. [From.GetSheHe] delivers a poem in [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s honor...and it is beautiful. Those gathered are moved, and the applause afterwards signifies that this ode will be written down and remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1235;Well done, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1235;I couldn't be more pleased;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_coronation_1235;How fabulous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1236;At one point in the coronation's festivities, [From.GetTitledName] stands and gets everyone's attention. [From.GetSheHe] delivers a poem in [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s honor...and it is terrible. Did [From.GetSheHe] intend to insult [From.GetHerHis] host, or was it an accident? The awkward coughs afterwards signify this moment is best forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1236;Awkward, indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1236;No, this is terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_coronation_1236;How awful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1238;'To our good host, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], long may [Root.GetSheHe] reign!'\n\n[From.GetTitledName] stands and delivers an eloquent toast in [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s honor at the coronation feast, prompting a round of approving applause from those gathered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1238;Many thanks, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1238;Long may [Root.GetSheHe] reign!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1240;On the night of the coronation feast, it seems everyone wants to dance with you. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] in particular, however, seems more interested than most. The way [From.GetSheHe] smiles at you, you suspect [From.GetSheHe] might be interested in more than just a dance with the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1240;Oh, really? Let's see where this goes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1240;A dance is more than sufficient;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1242;On the night of the coronation feast, it seems every [Root.GetManWomanOpp] wishes to dance with you. How tiresome. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] winks in your direction, seeming to understand your discomfort. Indeed, you suspect [From.GetSheHe] might understand better than most...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1242;Let's talk in private, [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1242;I'm not interested in [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1244;All throughout the coronation feast, [From.GetTitledName] has done nothing more than make caustic remarks about you when [From.GetSheHe] thinks you're not listening. You're not even certain why [From.GetSheHe] came to the coronation at all, if this is how [From.GetSheHe] feels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1244;Endure it—it's only one evening, after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1244;Confront [From.GetHerHim]—this needs to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1246;As if [From.GetHerHis] drinking weren't bad enough, [From.GetTitledName] managed to make quite the spectacle of [From.GetHerHim]self at the coronation feast, dancing on tables and carrying on until finally [From.GetSheHe] vomited on the floor in front of everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1246;Oh, wonderful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1248;For most of the coronation feast, [From.GetTitledName] acted normally...or as normally as one can expect [From.GetHerHim] to be, perhaps. Then a servant placed the wrong flagon before [From.GetHerHim], and that set him off: ranting and raving, until finally the hall watched in silence as [From.GetSheHe] was escorted away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1248;You could hear [From.GetHerHim] screaming from the halls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1275;The coronation feast finally draws to a close, with [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] giving a speech to those gathered that is barely heard over the raucous cheering. 'Long live the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]! Long live the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1275;Let's hope so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1275;A fine event, indeed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1321;The new ruler of the Byzantine Empire demands you coronate [From.GetHerHim] the rightful ruler of all the Romans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1321;[From.GetTitledFirstName] shall wear the Imperial crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_coronation_1321;No, [From.GetSheHe] is unworthy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1322;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to coronate you as the rightful ruler and thus solidify your hold on the throne. Let the preparations for the ceremony begin...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1324;The ceremonies are in full swing and the fate of [From.GetTitledFirstName] is being determined - will [From.GetSheHe] continue the inevitable decay of the Roman Empire, or will [From.GetSheHe] stop its advance? It is for you to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1326;[From.GetTitledName] crowned you in Hagia Sofia with all the pomp and ceremony due your station, but the air is regrettably one of formality.

It is an impressive ceremony, full of pomp and circumstance...though there is a lingering feeling among those present that they are witnessing not a resurgence of the empire's greatness, but simply one more step in its inevitable decline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_coronation_1327;Too bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1328;The traitorous [From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused to crown you! You can, of course, depose him and appoint someone more loyal to perform the coronation, but that probably won't be seen in a very favorable light by the faithful. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_coronation_1338;While some initially considered [Root.GetHerHim] to be a weak ruler, perhaps one destined to be lost in the history books, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has proven [Root.GetHerHim]self over the last years of [Root.GetHerHis] rule to be effective...so much so that some in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] are now whispering [Root.GetHerHis] name in the same tones once reserved for the great emperors of times past. There is a renewed belief that [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will lead the empire onto a great path, perhaps even all the way to the restoration of the Roman Empire of old!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_emf_imperial_3341;I need to warn [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3342;A bit of worrying news: [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] did not show up at a meeting to go over the plan. [From.GetSheHeCap] may have had second thoughts about taking part in the palace coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3342_informed;A bit of worrying news: [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] did not show up at a meeting to go over the plan. Not only that, your sources tell you [From.GetSheHe] may have informed [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] of the coming danger, though [From.GetSheHe] did not know enough to overly endanger you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3343;My liege,\nWhile I cannot go into a great amount of detail, I feel I must inform you that you are in danger.

EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3348;As the hour grows dark in the [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName] imperial palace, suddenly there is shouting from the shadowy halls. You hear the sound of steel on steel, of men engaged in combat, and someone shouts 'Treachery!' A battle is underway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3348;Who is behind this?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3349;The fighting within the imperial palace is vicious, and while you do your best to avoid the worst of it you are still confronted by an imperial guard. After a brief struggle you manage to kill the man, but not before he stabs you in the side...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3349;Just my luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3350;The fighting within the imperial palace is vicious, and you almost don't know where to turn. You see what you think is an imperial guard and run towards him, but realize too late from the gleam in his eye that he is, in fact, one of the traitors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3350;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3351;Battles rage through the halls of the imperial palace, and just as [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] turns a corner [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is suddenly attacked by an imperial guard. Before the guard can impale [FromFrom.GetHerHim] with his sword, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] barrels into him from behind and knocks him over, saving [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3351;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap]'s lucky I was there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_imperial_3351;I'm lucky [From.GetSheHe] was there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3352;Battles rage through the halls of the imperial palace, and just as [coup_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] turns a corner [coup_target.GetSheHe] is suddenly attacked by a treacherous soldier.

EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3353;During the course of the battle in the palace, [coup_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] turns a corner and spots [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] down a long hall. Their eyes meet, and the [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] knows right then that this [From.GetManWoman] is one of the traitors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_imperial_3353;If I survive tonight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3354;Things are not going well. Already you see your forces scattering, routed, and just as you are about to give the order to retreat you are stabbed from behind by an imperial guard. He is cut down by several of your own men, but even so you feel blackness closing in on you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3354;Damn, I was so close!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3355;Things are going well. Your guardsmen have the coup well in hand, and just before you declare the imperial palace retaken you feel a knife stabbing you from behind. The assassin is cut down by several of your own men, but even so you feel blackness closing in on you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3355;No, this cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3356;You are in [Root.Location.GetName] when you receive word of a disturbance at the imperial palace back at [Root.Capital.GetName].

EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3356;The perpretators will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3357;Things appear to be going well. You men have the imperial guard on the run, and most of the palace is already under your control.

The soldier is cut down by several of your own, but even so you feel blackness closing in on you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3358;You are in [Root.Location.GetName] when you receive word of a disturbance at the imperial palace back at [Root.Capital.GetName]. Someone is attempting to engineer a coup while you are away, and while the details are still scarce it seems the worst may come to pass...they may actually succeed. You gather what men you can and start racing back to the capital, but it is likely far too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3358;Who is behind this? They will pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3359;Everywhere you turn there is a bloody battle. Worse, your imperial guardsmen appear to be losing! Just as the few men who remain at your side advise you to flee the imperial palace, you feel a knife stabbing into your back. The assassin is quickly cut down, but even so you feel blackness closing in on you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3369;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nMy time in [From.Location.GetName] wears on me, and I yearn for opportunities elsewhere in the empire. Perhaps I might find a place in your court at [Root.Capital.GetName]? I think you could find my skills a useful addition to your council.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3369;You would be most welcome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_imperial_3369;No, I think not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3375;There has been considerable talk within the court regarding corruption in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and now a [bureaucrat.GetBestName] has approached you with a proposal for several laws that will ideally reform the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3375;That sounds like an excellent idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_imperial_3375;No, not right now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3376;[bureaucrat.GetBestName] has approached the court with a proposal to reform imperial taxes, something which has gained a great deal of popularity within the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] bureaucracy even if it's hardly guaranteed to have the effect [bureaucrat.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] promises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3377;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] bureaucracy is a thing that sometimes seems to have a life of its own, and while it is needed to run the empire sometimes things just get lost within its labyrinthine rules and corrupt practices...such as your taxes, for instance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3377;What? The culprits must be found!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3378;With each passing year, it seems that the bureaucracy required to keep the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] gets larger and larger. So many of the lord and ladies within your court appear to have greater knowledge of how the bureaucracy works than you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3379;The intrigues within the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] court are many. The latest has come with an offer: [courtier.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] believes [courtier.GetSheHe] can help you with a vassal who doesn't like you very much, at least for a time. Why [courtier.GetSheHe] wishes to help you, you're not even quite certain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3379;Do what you can;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_imperial_3379;I don't need help with [problem_vassal.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3380;You weren't even present when it happened: evidently [first_courtier.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [second_courtier.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] had some kind of argument during court, something which has become increasingly vicious over the last several days as each of them drags more fellow courtiers into their feud. Both have approached you to ask for your support against the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3380;Support [first_courtier.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_imperial_3380;Support [second_courtier.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_imperial_3380;Do not get me involved in this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_imperial_3380;I will help them work this out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3381;The imperial court is a living, breathing organ within the palace. Lords and ladies come and go, plotting behind their smiles and doing their best to climb up the social ladder and into your good graces as if you didn't notice their maneuvering to get there. Is this truly what the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] has come to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3382;[guard.GetBestName] has approached you with a proposal to reform the regulations used to raise and train the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] levies. [guard.GetHerHisCap] ideas have a great deal of support within the court, though others say they also have a good chance of going very wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3383;You have always enjoyed a cadre of personal guard to protect your person, but recently [guard.GetBestName] has proven [guard.GetHerHis] loyalty and determination to be the best of them. Indeed, just the other day [guard.GetSheHe] stopped a would-be assassin from entering the palace grounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3383;Well done! I feel safer already;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_imperial_3385;A Hero Rises;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3385;With [From.GetHerHis] performance at the Battle of [From.Location.GetName] receiving notice throughout the empire, many are declaring [From.GetBestName] a [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] hero - the sort that tales are told of and, some suggest, the sort who rise to themselves become [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3385;Oh, is that so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_imperial_3385;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3386;Recently there has been talk within the court of how capable [guard.GetBestName] is. They laud [guard.GetHerHis] martial prowess, and implicit within their whispers is that the [guard.GetManWoman] is a better warrior than you...the sort of warrior who could do great things if [guard.GetSheHe] were to rule the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3386;It had best remain talk, and nothing more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_imperial_3387;Word has reached your ears that [From.GetBestName] has been spreading word regarding [From.GetHerHis] claim to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] throne. According to [From.GetHerHim], you are a corrupt ruler who is weakening the empire, and only [From.GetSheHe] can lead it to greatness. Perhaps this is just an exaggeration?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_imperial_3387;We shall see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
