# -*- ck2.custom_loc -*-

# Customizable localization for buildings is called from the title scope of the holding where the building is. ROOT and FROM do not work because this title scope is "pure", i.e. it does not see that it is being used in the context of a building for a holding. Use "location" instead of ROOT to get the holding's province and "holder_scope" instead of FROM to get the holding's owner.
