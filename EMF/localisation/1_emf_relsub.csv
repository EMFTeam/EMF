emf_relsub.0.desc.overlord;To the infidel dog [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nYour false [Root.EMF_GetGodHas] abandoned you to the ignominy of defeat by the supreme will of [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetHighGodName]. You would be wise to abandon them as well and bend the knee to me and to the true [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetName] faith, or you will lose more than just your dignity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.desc.underling;To the misguided [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nYour liege's folly and faith in [Root.Liege.GetPossPronoun] false [Root.Liege.GetGodWas] laughably inadequate in holding back the assault on [Root.Liege.GetPossPronoun] lands. You, however, I trust are wise enough to accept the same offer I gave [Root.Liege.GetObjectPronoun]: bend the knee and convert to the [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetName] faith, or your lands are mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.desc.underling_samerel;My dear [Root.EMF_GetSisterBrotherNoRelation] in faith,\n\nThough we both must bow before the will of [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetHighGodName], you must bend the knee to me. Will you submit and aid me in bringing the true Faith to these lands, or will you place yourself on the side of these infidels?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.opt.submit_and_convert;Who am I to contend with [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetRandomGodName]? I will swear fealty to my new [emf_cb_winner.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.opt.submit_samerel;Finally, I can serve a liege that follows [emf_cb_winner.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.opt.submit_and_pretend_to_convert;I will bow before their false idols, but in my heart I stand blameless before [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.opt.refuse_diffcul;I'll never dirty my knees before these [emf_cb_winner.Culture.GetName] fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.opt.refuse_diffrel;I'll never bend the knee to these [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetName] infidels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.opt.refuse_samerelcul;I'd rather lose my land than lose my soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.1.desc;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nOur new liege [emf_cb_winner.GetTitledFirstName] in [emf_cb_winner.GetPossPronoun] infinite mercy has extended us the opportunity to forsake our false [emf_old_religion.EMF_GetGodGods] and embraced [emf_cb_winner.GetRandomGodName]. I implore you to reconsider your errant ways and convert to the true [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.1.opt.convert_too;I'll follow my liege and embrace the [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.1.opt.pretend_to_convert_too;Rather than truly embrace this faith, I'll make it serve me instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.1.opt.refuse;My heart cannot forsake [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. I cannot follow you in this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.20.desc;Our glorious [Root.EMF_GetGHWName] against the [emf_cb_loser.EMF_GetInfidelHeathen] [emf_cb_loser.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] has finally come to an end with the capitulation of [emf_cb_loser.GetTitledFirstName], a fool for resisting the unstoppable advance of my armies and the will of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!\n\nBut victory is not yet complete: the knees of many have not yet bent, and the hearts of many more have not yet learned [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s truth. I now must decide upon how to bring these people into the fold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.20.opt.approach_lightly;Let us tread lightly, for such dramatic change takes time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.20.opt.approach_normally;We must use our authority to show them the righteous way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.20.opt.approach_aggressively;Whether by word or by sword, the [emf_cb_loser.EMF_GetInfidelHeathen]s must submit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.21.desc.subjugated_overlord;In a demonstration of unlikely wisdom, [emf_cb_loser.GetTitledFirstName] chose to swear fealty as my vassal lord and embrace our [Root.EMF_GetGodGods]. Though I would not be able to seize [emf_cb_loser.GetHerHis] titles for my own, I have won a greater victory for our now shared faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.21.desc.subjugated_underlings;[emf_cb_loser.GetTitledFirstName] threw my ultimatum in my face and refused to submit. However, some of [emf_cb_loser.GetPossPronoun] vassals broke with [emf_cb_loser.GetPossPronoun] refusal and have offered to swear fealty as my own vassal lords and embrace our [Root.EMF_GetGodGods].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.21.desc.subjugated_nobody;Sadly for the [emf_cb_loser.EMF_GetInfidelHeathen]s, not so much as one of them was willing to accept my terms. In fitting recompense for their defiance, all of their lands within the [emf_cb_title.GetFullBaseName] are now mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.21.opt.ok_normal;That'll do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.21.opt.ok_no_counties_seized;That'll do, even if no counties were seized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.21.opt.ok_no_lords_converted;So be it, even if no [Root.EMF_GetInfidelHeathen] lords converted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.21.opt.no_counties_seized_so_usurp_prov_1;But I'll take [emf_prov_1.GetName] for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.21.opt.no_counties_seized_so_usurp_prov_2;But I'll take [emf_prov_2.GetName] for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.21.opt.no_counties_seized_so_usurp_prov_3;But I'll take [emf_prov_3.GetName] for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
