####  EVENTS                          #
#######################################
# PLACEHOLDER: current text describes it, more or less. this one only goes to the war loser. it is fired directly from the CB success effect -- there's no intervening event for the war winner.
emf_relsub.0.desc.overlord;To the infidel dog [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nYour false [Root.EMF_GetGodHas] abandoned you to the ignominy of defeat by the supreme will of [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetHighGodName]. You would be wise to abandon them as well and bend the knee to me and to the true [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetName] faith, or you will lose more than just your dignity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER: key points: 1) all of their lieges (the first being the loser of the war) refused to bend the knee, so now the same ultimatum is offered to them
emf_relsub.0.desc.underling;To the misguided [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nYour liege's folly and faith in [Root.Liege.GetPossPronoun] false [Root.Liege.GetGodWas] laughably inadequate in holding back the assault on [Root.Liege.GetPossPronoun] lands. You, however, I trust are wise enough to accept the same offer I gave [Root.Liege.GetObjectPronoun]: bend the knee and convert to the [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetName] faith, or your lands are mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER: key points: 1) same as (1) above, 2) underling is actually same-religion as the holy war winner, so there's no need for them to convert faith & in a sense, they're liberated. yet, they still can choose whether to bend the knee.
emf_relsub.0.desc.underling_samerel;My dear [Root.EMF_GetSisterBrotherNoRelation] in faith,\n\nThough we both must bow before the will of [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetHighGodName], you must bend the knee to me. Will you submit and aid me in bringing the true Faith to these lands, or will you place yourself on the side of these infidels?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.opt.submit_and_convert;Who am I to contend with [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetRandomGodName]? I will swear fealty to my new [emf_cb_winner.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.opt.submit_samerel;Finally, I can serve a liege that follows [emf_cb_winner.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.opt.submit_and_pretend_to_convert;I will bow before their false idols, but in my heart I stand blameless before [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.opt.refuse_diffcul;I'll never dirty my knees before these [emf_cb_winner.Culture.GetName] fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.opt.refuse_diffrel;I'll never bend the knee to these [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetName] infidels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.0.opt.refuse_samerelcul;I'd rather lose my land than lose my soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER: Once a ruler submits, their vassals of a different religion than the one being converted to get this event (61) recursively down the realm tree (same-religion vassals are passed through a hidden event to allow propogation down the tree, but we avoid showing them a useless event). unlike those that receive the ultimatum event, it's already known that they're going to be part of a new realm, so the question is only whether to convert with their liege, pretend to convert with their liege, or refuse to convert.
emf_relsub.1.desc;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nOur new liege [emf_cb_winner.GetTitledFirstName] in [emf_cb_winner.GetPossPronoun] infinite mercy has extended us the opportunity to forsake our false [emf_old_religion.EMF_GetGodGods] and embraced [emf_cb_winner.GetRandomGodName]. I implore you to reconsider your errant ways and convert to the true [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.1.opt.convert_too;I shall follow my liege's example and embrace the [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetName] Faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.1.opt.pretend_to_convert_too;Rather than serve this [emf_cb_winner.Religion.GetName] faith, I will make it serve me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.1.opt.refuse;My heart cannot forsake [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. I cannot follow you in this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER: start event where war victor chooses their approach to handling the conquered infidels = emf_relsub.20, so all 4 keys below are for that:

emf_relsub.20.opt.approach_normally;PLACEHOLDER: medium;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_relsub.20.opt.approach_aggressively;PLACEHOLDER: heavy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER: event #63 is the return event back to the holy war winner once everything else has been decided. only option is acknowledgement. the 3 event option texts are mutually exclusive variants, as are the 3 descriptions (obviously, in that case). the following desc variant happens when we managed to actually subjugate the original holy war loser. Note all the variables that are accessible to you for mentioning in the event description -- I collected them for just this reason.
emf_relsub.21.desc.subjugated_overlord;PLACEHOLDER: Subjugated overlord!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER: we didn't subjugate the original holy war loser, but we did subjugate some other lords.
emf_relsub.21.desc.subjugated_underlings;PLACEHOLDER: Subjugated underlings! (Likely took some titles);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER: we "failed" to subjugate anybody (so, basically, we took some titles and that's about it)
emf_relsub.21.desc.subjugated_nobody;PLACEHOLDER: Subjugated nobody! (Took all titles!);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER: generic acknowledgement event option (mutually exclusive set: ok_normal, ok_no_counties_seized, ok_no_lords_converted)
emf_relsub.21.opt.ok_normal;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER
emf_relsub.21.opt.ok_no_counties_seized;Excellent -- even if no counties were seized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER
emf_relsub.21.opt.ok_no_lords_converted;Excellent -- even if no rulers were converted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER: 0-3 of the following 3 event options may be present in addition to the standard acknowledgment
emf_relsub.21.opt.no_counties_seized_so_usurp_prov_1;Take [emf_prov_1.GetName] for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER
emf_relsub.21.opt.no_counties_seized_so_usurp_prov_2;Take [emf_prov_2.GetName] for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# PLACEHOLDER
emf_relsub.21.opt.no_counties_seized_so_usurp_prov_3;Take [emf_prov_3.GetName] for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
