EVTOPTC7255;Reveal the truth to all that will listen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_150_transit;Finally, an opportunity has arisen to abduct [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] when [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] takes a planned journey from [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName] to a nearby town. Shall I tell my co-conspirators to begin their preparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_150_bed;Finally, an opportunity to abduct [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has arisen. One of the [Root.PlotTarget.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s personal guard has proven amenable to bribery, allowing for the opportunity to take [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] while [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] sleeps. Shall I tell my co-conspirators to begin their preparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_150_hunting;Finally, an opportunity has arisen to abduct [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] when [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] goes on a planned hunting trip over a week from now. The perfect chance to catch [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] away from court! Shall I tell my co-conspirators to begin their preparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_150_carouse;Finally, an opportunity to abduct [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has arisen. The [Root.PlotTarget.GetManWoman]'s amourous nature has betrayed [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim]--a planned trip to a brothel in [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName] will prove the perfect chance, if we move quickly. Shall I tell my co-conspirators to begin their preparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_150;We must proceed with the plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_150;Not yet, this is too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_151;At last, after having watched our target here in [Root.Location.GetName] for so long, an opportunity for abduction has arisen. I must tell the others at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_151;With luck, this will be over soon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_152;My dear [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nIt seems the opportunity to abduct [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is finally upon us. I ask that you stand ready to make your move. If we fail this chance, it will not come again quickly.\n\nMy thanks,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_155;My co-conspirators send word that they have prepared everything we need to discredit [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]. Documents of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] corruption have been prepared, and courtiers have been bribed to whisper to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis]'s incompetence. With [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] reputation in tatters, [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] will find it impossible to hold on to [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] position on the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_155;That position will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_156;I have found myself the target of a vicious campaign of slander at court. Rumors of incompetence and corruption have undermined the authority of my position, and it seems that even [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] have come to believe them as I have been removed from my position at the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_156;I am ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_157;The attempt to discredit [From.GetTitledFirstName] was a success! [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] has dismissed [From.GetHerHim] from the council and [From.GetHerHis] position is now vacant and ready for me to occupy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_157;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_158;Lately it seems that I have heard nothing but bad of [From.GetTitledFirstName], from whispers of incompetence at court to documents proving [From.GetHerHis] corruption slipped under my bedroom door at night. I refused to believe it at first, but in the end I could not deny the weight of the evidence and was forced to remove [From.GetTitledFirstName] from [From.GetHerHis] position at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_158;It had to be done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_159;I have found myself the target of a vicious campaign of slander at court. Whispers of incompetence and accusations of corruption have been directed at me, but fortunately [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] has refused to give them credence and ordered an investigation into the source of the rumors. Although the investigation turned up nothing, my position at court is secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_159;Who could have instigated such an underhanded scheme?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_160;Despite the rumors and accusations directed at [From.GetTitledFirstName], [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] refused to dismiss [From.GetHerHim] from the council and has ordered an investigation into the source of the rumors. Fortunately, the investigation turned up no evidence of my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_160;It could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_161;Lately it seems that I have heard nothing but bad of [From.GetTitledFirstName], from whispers of incompetence at court to documents proving [From.GetHerHis] corruption slipped under my bedroom door at night. A thorough questioning of the court turned up nothing, but has at least put a stop to the slanderous accusations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_162;I have found myself the target of a vicious campaign of slander at court. Whispers of incompetence and accusations of corruption have been directed at me, but fortunately [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] refused to give them credence and ordered an investigation into their source, which revealed the involvement [From.GetTitledName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_162;[From.GetTitledFirstName] will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_163;Despite the rumors and accusations directed at [From.GetTitledFirstName], [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] refused to dismiss [From.GetHerHim] from the council. Even worse, [Root.Liege.GetFirstName] ordered an investigation into the source of the rumors, which turned up evidence of my involvement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_163;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] is not pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_164;Lately it seems that I have heard nothing but bad of [From.GetTitledFirstName], from whispers of incompetence at court to documents proving [From.GetHerHis] corruption slipped under my bedroom door at night. I refused to believe the accusations and ordered an investigation of their source, which revealed the involvement of [FromFrom.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_164;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_170;The tithes and taxes for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] are on their way to [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] castle and my co-conspirators have bribed the guards not to notice if a chest or two should go 'missing'. Everything is ready for the robbery to proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_170;We'll all be rich!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_171;The taxes and tithes due to me arrived at the castle today and were placed in the treasury. As I was inspecting the chests full of gold, it struck me that there seemed to be fewer of them than what had arrived earlier. A quick check of the treasurer's accounts revealed my worst fears...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_171;I have been robbed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_172;As the taxes were being hauled into the treasury, several large chests full of gold made their way onto the back of a wagon which left the castle unnoticed. The gold is now safely locked away in my treasury and my co-conspirators have all received their share.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_172;Everything went as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_173;I have received my share of the money embezzled by [From.GetTitledFirstName] from [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_174;The taxes and tithes due to me arrived at the castle today. As the coin was being carried into the treasury, some shadowy figures attempted to make off with several chests full of gold...and they would have gotten away had my guards not been alert. The figures were seized and, under questioning, revealed themselves to be in the employ of [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_174;Unbelieveable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_175;As the taxes were being hauled into the treasury, my men tried to make off with several chests of gold but were spotted by [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s guards and seized. Under questioning they revealed to myself to be in my employ, and now [From.GetTitledFirstName] knows that I attempted to rob [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_175;Retribution is sure to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_180;My co-conspirators have fabricated evidence that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is planning a revolt against [Root.PlotTarget.Liege.GetHerHis] liege. The evidence will discreetly find its way into the hands of [Root.PlotTarget.Liege.GetTitledFirstName], who cannot fail to act on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_180;I will see [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] disgraced!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_181;Word has reached me that [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] has publicly accused me of treason based on evidence found in some documents that were slipped under [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] bedroom door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_181;This must be a scheme to see me arrested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_182;[From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] was completely fooled by the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. It can only be a matter of time before [From.GetSheHe] is arrested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_183;As I rose from bed, I found a small bundle of documents that had been slipped beneath my bedroom door. The documents contained evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s plans to depose me and seize my titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_183;I must have [From.GetHerHim] arrested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_184;As I rose from bed, I found a small bundle of documents that had been slipped beneath my bedroom door. The documents contained evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s plans to depose me and seize my titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_184;I wonder who sent it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_185;[From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. Although the scheme has failed, at least there is no evidence of my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_186;As I rose from bed, I found a small bundle of documents that had been slipped beneath my bedroom door. The documents contained evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s plans to depose me and seize my titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_186;Nothing but lies and slander;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_187;[From.GetTitledFirstName] tried to have me arrested for treason by slipping fabricated 'evidence' under [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s bedroom door, but fortunately [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] caught [From.GetHerHis] agent in the act and now it is [From.GetTitledFirstName] that stands accused of treason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_187;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_188;My agent was caught in the act of slipping the fabricated evidence under [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s bedroom door. Even worse, my involvement was revealed during questioning and now I am the one that stands accused of treason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_188;This is bad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_189;As I was getting ready to sleep, I heard a scuffle from outside my bedroom door. Rushing outside, I found that my guards had seized a cloaked man as he was attempting to slip some documents into the room. Under questioning, he revealed that he was working for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] and that the documents were fabricated evidence intended to turn me against my vassal [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_189;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is the true traitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_195;My co-conspirators have fabricated evidence of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]'s blasphemous conduct and sheltering of heretics. The letter will be sent to [Root.PlotTarget.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] who will be forced to excommunicate [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_195;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] will be my judge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_196;Word has reached me that [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] has had me excommunicated based on fabricated 'evidence' of blasphemy and heresy sent to [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] in an anonymous letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_196;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] preserve me from these lies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_197;[From.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] was completely fooled by the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s heresy. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been excommunicated and interdict has been placed on [From.GetHerHis] lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_197;It was the will of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_198;Word has reached me that [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] has received fabricated 'evidence' of blasphemy and heresy sent to [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] in an anonymous letter. Fortunately, [Root.RelHead.GetSheHe] dismissed it as the slanderous lie it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_198;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] looks after the faithful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_199;[From.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s heresy. Although the scheme has failed, at least there is no evidence of my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_200;Word has reached me that [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] has received fabricated 'evidence' of blasphemy and heresy sent to [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] in an anonymous letter. However, [Root.RelHead.GetSheHe] not only refused to believe it, but had the messenger questioned until he revealed the sender of the letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_200;It was sent by [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_201;[From.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s heresy. What's worse, [From.RelHead.GetSheHe] had the messenger questioned and found out that I sent it! I have been censured for my 'unseemly scheming' and [From.GetTitledFirstName] knows that I tried to have [From.GetHerHim] excommunicated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_201;This will not help my reputation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_205;My co-conspirators have fabricated evidence that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is planning a revolt against me. I will circulate the evidence among my vassals so that they will support my actions against the 'traitor'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_206;Word has reached me that documents indicting me in a plan to revolt against [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have been circulating through the realm. Though the evidence is obviously a forgery, it seems almost everyone in the realm has been fooled by it, and I fear I am about to be arrested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_206;Who could have done such a thing?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_207;My vassals were completely fooled by the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. I am now free to act against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_208;Word has reached me that documents indicting me in a plan to revolt against [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have been circulating through the realm. Fortunately most of the lords of the realm have dismissed it as the forgery it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_208;I wonder who was behind it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_209;My vassals refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. Although the scheme has failed, at least there is no evidence of my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_210;Word has reached me that documents indicting me in a plan to revolt against [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have been circulating through the realm. One of the forger's agents was caught while handing out the forgeries on my lands, and questioning revealed him to be working for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_211;My vassals refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. What's worse, one of my agents was caught and questioned while circulating the forgeries, and my involvement has been revealed to all my vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_211;My reputation is ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_215;Success! [kidnap_victim.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has been delivered in a sack to an abandoned keep near [kidnap_victim.Location.GetName]. There [kidnap_victim.GetSheHe] is at my mercy, and no-one can hear [kidnap_victim.GetHerHis] screams. All that remains is to decide what to do with [kidnap_victim.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_215;[kidnap_victim.GetSheHeCap] will give me the [demanded_title.GetFullName], or else!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_215;[kidnap_victim.GetSheHeCap] will name [demanded_vassal.GetTitledName] my vassal, or else!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_intrigue_215;Bring [kidnap_victim.GetHerHim] to my dungeon--I will decide later;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_intrigue_215;Now [kidnap_victim.GetSheHe] dies--quietly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_216;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! You struggle, but it is no use--your captors are strong, and it is not long before you find yourself in the dungeons of [From.GetTitledName]. There, [From.GetSheHe] informs you, you shall remain until [From.GetSheHe] decides otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_216;[From.GetSheHeCap] will pay for this outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_217;[From.GetTitledName] recently went missing, and after a frantic search by [From.GetHerHis] guards, it seemed as if [From.GetSheHe] had simply vanished into thin air! Not so, apparently. It turns out [From.GetSheHe] was forcibly abducted by agents of [FromFrom.GetTitledName], who intends to keep [From.GetHerHim] in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] dungeons until [FromFrom.GetSheHe] decides otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_218;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! You struggle, but it is no use--your captors are strong, and it is not long before you find yourself in a dungeon. There, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] reveals [From.GetHerHim]self as your captor, and states you have only to hand over the [demanded_title.GetFullName] to achieve your freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_218;Take it! Just let me go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_218;[From.GetSheHeCap] will get nothing from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_219;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] clearly didn't like it, but then again you left [From.GetHerHim] little choice. The [demanded_title.GetFullName] is yours. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has not told anyone exactly how you got the title, of course, but there are whispers. Even so, what does it matter now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_220;While [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] earlier seemed to have no intention of granting the [demanded_title.GetFullName] to anyone, suddenly [From.GetSheHe] changed [From.GetHerHis] mind and granted it to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]. Could this have something to do with [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s recent unexplained absence from [From.Location.GetName]? No-one appears to know for certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_221;'You will get nothing from me! Do your worst!' [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] spits in your face, refusing to give into your demands...though you can clearly see the fear in [From.GetHerHis] face. The [From.GetManWoman] is brave, evidently. So now what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_221;Now [From.GetSheHe] rots in my dungeon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_221;Now [From.GetSheHe] dies--quietly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_intrigue_221;I'm not going to kill [From.GetHerHim]! Just...let [From.GetHerHim] go;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_222;'Then you will remain a guest in my dungeon until I decide just what to do with you,' [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] says with a shrug. With that, [From.GetSheHe] leaves, and you are left in the dark and the cold to wonder whether that was the wisest choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_223;After recently vanishing without a trace from [FromFrom.GetHerHis] court, [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s lifeless corpse was discovered soon afterwards on the bank of a nearby river. People throughout [Root.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are shocked by the scandal, which gets worse when it is revealed that [From.GetTitledName] was behind the deed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_224;While [From.GetSheHe] appears torn, it turns out that [From.GetSheHe] cannot, in fact, order your death. [From.GetSheHe] turns and walks out, swearing, and some time later you are discovered by a passing peasant and released. You are unharmed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_224;A relief, but still...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_225;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! You struggle, but it is no use--your captors are strong, and it is not long before you find yourself in a dungeon. There, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] reveals [From.GetHerHim]self as your captor, and states you have only to make [demanded_vassal.GetTitledName] [From.GetHerHis] vassal to achieve your freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_225;Take the vassal, just let me go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_226;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nI cannot tell you the reasons behind my decision. Simply trust that they exist. With that in mind, I have elected to transfer your vassalage to [FromFrom.GetTitledName], effective immediately. May [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] have mercy upon us all.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_227;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] clearly didn't like it, but then again you left [From.GetHerHim] little choice. [demanded_vassal.GetTitledName] is now your vassal. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has not told anyone exactly how this arrangement came to be, of course, but there are whispers. Even so, what does it matter now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_228;While [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] earlier seemed to have no intention of surrendering any of [From.GetHerHis] vassals to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], suddenly [From.GetSheHe] changed [From.GetHerHis] mind and granted [FromFrom.GetHerHim] lordship over [demanded_vassal.GetTitledName]. Could this have something to do with [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s recent unexplained absence from [From.Location.GetName]? No-one appears to know for certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_229;Alas, [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] surprised the kidnappers with the ferocity of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] struggle, and they were forced to flee when [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] guards came running. While an investigation is underway, currently no-one is aware that you were behind the assault.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_230;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! Outraged, you struggle--well enough that guards come running, and your kidnappers are forced to flee. Sadly, they escaped...meaning you have no idea who was behind this assault on your person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_230;Surely SOMEONE must know the truth?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_231;Disaster! [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] surprised the kidnappers with the ferocity of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] struggle, and while they fled when guards came running, they were quickly caught. Even worse, the men gave up your name as their employer! You've denied it, naturally, but [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] clearly does not believe you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_232;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! Outraged, you struggle--well enough that guards come running, and your kidnappers are forced to flee. They are quickly caught, and upon questioning give up [From.GetTitledName] as their employer. [From.GetSheHeCap] tried to have you abducted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_262A;Unsettling news—while you currently have no proof of it, you are all but certain that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is conspiring with unknown parties to wrest the regency from your grasp. Unless you act soon, [From.GetSheHe] may very well soon succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_262B;Unsettling news—while you currently have no proof of it, you are all but certain that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is conspiring with unknown parties to wrest the regency from [Root.Liege.Regent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. just as you are. If you do not act to stop [From.GetHerHim] now, [From.GetSheHe] may very well beat you to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_262;I will stop [From.GetHerHim], if I can;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_262;I must wait for proof, and not make things worse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_263A;Your scheming to replace [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent apparently came to [From.GetHerHis] notice, as suddenly you find yourself without access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] at all. Worse, any efforts to bring the matter before the court have evaporated. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has outmaneuvered you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_263B;Your scheming to replace [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent apparently came to the notice of [From.GetTitledName], as [From.GetSheHe] has somehow not only blocked your access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] but also to the court. You have been outmaneuvered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_264;You acted quickly to block [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], and to ensure [FromFrom.GetSheHe] would have no chance to bring the matter before the court...and you were successful. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] has been outmaneuvered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_265;While you tried to block [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [FromFrom.GetSheHe] somehow managed to get around your efforts even so. If [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is truly scheming against you, [FromFrom.GetHerHis] efforts continue as before, unhindered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_266;At first it seems like [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has become aware of your scheme to take the regency, but [From.GetHerHis] bungling has only infuriated some of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s courtiers and made it more likely that your efforts will come to fruition far sooner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_267;While you tried to block [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [FromFrom.GetSheHe] somehow managed to get around your efforts even so. Worse, you managed to infuriate some of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s courtiers and made [FromFrom.GetHerHis] scheming far easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_268;You're uncertain what's going on in the court, exactly, but you know something is. [FromFrom.GetTitledName] is no longer allowed to see you, and you don't know why...only that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] says it's for the best. Maybe it is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_269;Something is amiss in your court, but you don't understand exactly what. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] came to visit you recently and said that your regent, [From.GetTitledName], is bungling things badly. With any luck, that will soon change and then [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will be around far more. Wouldn't that be grand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_270A;As both [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent and heir, it has not been a difficult matter to get agreement on the idea that perhaps it is time I take over rule of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth. It is not as if [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] is going to get better, after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_270B;With [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] unable to rule, it has fallen to you to ensure things in [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] continue to run smoothly. As such close family to [Root.Liege.GetHerHim], there are many who are willing to see [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regent become the ruler in truth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_270C;As [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent, it has not been overly difficult to arrange a conspiracy to see you take over rule of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth. The time for the attempt to be made appears to now be at hand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_270;Let us make the attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_270;No, I should abandon this now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_271;While you have slowly assumed more and more of the duties of rulership in [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName], it seems you were unable to convince [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s councillors and lords to take that final step. They have not restricted your powers, but it's clear they'll resist any attempts for you to take control...for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_272;It seems your efforts to take the rule of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] into your own hands were noticed too soon. Several of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s vassals took serious exception to the idea and raised a great furor, and now your attempt is being called both treachery and usurpation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_273;You're not quite sure what all the fuss is, but a bunch of soldiers came in and arrested [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. They said [From.GetSheHe] was trying to take away your throne! What an odd thing to do. It's so large! Where would [From.GetSheHe] put it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_273;I suppose they'll find me another regent, now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_274;Dangerous business is afoot in [Root.Liege.Capital.GetName]: [From.GetTitledName] attempted to usurp [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s titles, and as [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regent [From.GetSheHe] very well almost got away with it! [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has been arrested, and another regent shall be found for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] shortly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_275;Success! Your duties as regent have been expanded to the point where the difference between you and [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is a mere formality...a formality which has now been dispensed with entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_276A;Perhaps it was time. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] came to tell you that [From.GetSheHe] would be taking over rule of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] formally, and thus would no longer be my regent. [From.GetSheHeCap] was my heir, so...that's good, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_276B;Dear [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] came to tell you that [From.GetSheHe] would be taking over rule of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] formally, and thus would no longer be my regent. [From.GetSheHeCap] said it was for my own good, and for the good of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]...and you're hardly in a position to disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_276C;Everyone's making such a fuss. You can barely understand it, but it seems [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] rules in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] now, and not you. But that doesn't seem right, does it? [From.GetSheHeCap]'s your regent, not the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]! Yet everyone keeps saying it, so it must be true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_276;I hope being [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] makes [From.GetHerHim] happy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_277A;With [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] no longer able to rule, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has stepped up from being simply [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regent and heir to ruling [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth. Many consider the move for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_277B;With [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] no longer able to rule, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has slowly transformed from being simply [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regent to ruling [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth. Despite [From.GetHerHis] close relation to [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], some are calling this an usurpation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_277C;Dangerous business is afoot in [Root.Liege.Capital.GetName]: [From.GetTitledName] has slowly expanded [From.GetHerHis] duties as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent until the distinction between them was a mere formality...and now that formality has been dispensed with entirely. [From.GetSheHeCap] has usurped the rule of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_280;After many months of effort, you have found several [Root.Culture.GetName] lords in [Root.Capital.County.GetName] who quietly seethe at the rule of [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]...and with some subtle pushes, they could become much less quiet. Of course, this will also give [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s spymaster the best chance to catch you in the act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_280;Let us proceed with this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_280;It's too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_281;Success! The [Root.Culture.GetName] lords have no idea you were the person behind their 'donations'...nor the incidents which have made their rage against [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] all the greater. Now it simply remains to see if this leads to anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_282;Alas, the [Root.Culture.GetName] lords are either too cowardly to speak openly against [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] or their words fall on too many deaf ears. Nothing has come of your efforts in [Root.Capital.County.GetName], but thankfully no-one is aware of your involvement. We will have to wait for another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_283;Disaster! One of the [Root.Culture.GetName] lords recognized your agent, and evidently believed that you were trying to trick him. He has been complaining loudly in [Root.Capital.GetName], loudly enough that agents of [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] overheard and have pieced together what really happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_284;My [Root.GetLordLady], we have word from an agent in [From.Capital.County.GetName] that [From.GetTitledName] was attempting to incite rebellion amongst the [From.Culture.GetName] peasants--a rebellion that almost certainly would have been directed against your rule. [From.GetHerHisCap] efforts thankfully failed, and we have proof of [From.GetHerHis] deeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_284;Has [From.GetSheHe] gone mad?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_285;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nIt has recently come to my attention that [From.GetBestName] plots against you, and thus I felt it best if you were to be aware of that fact. I trust you will take whatever steps required to protect yourself.\n\nWith respect,\n[FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_285;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] is [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s liege -- [FromFrom.GetSheHe] should do something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_285;This is good to know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_286;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI truly appreciate your assistance in alerting me to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s scheme, though as [FromFrom.GetHerHis] liege, I truly hope you will also take steps to deal with [FromFrom.GetHerHis] criminal behavior.\n\nWith gratitude,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_287;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI truly appreciate your assistance in alerting me to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s scheme. It seems I will have to deal with [FromFrom.GetHerHim], and quickly.\n\nWith gratitude,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_288;Unfortunately, it appears that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has become aware of your plot against [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim]. You strongly suspect that [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s spymaster learned of the plot and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] then revealed it to [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1350;I have been gearing up for this confrontation for some time now. I have gained an audience, and will ask my real father to recognize me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1350;It's now or never...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1351;It was rather unexpected when [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked for an audience, but when [From.GetSheHe] arrived [From.GetSheHe] explained that [From.GetSheHe] is a fully-grown [From.GetManWoman]...one that [From.GetSheHe] hopes is worthy of being considered your legitimate child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1351;That is not going to happen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1351;Convince [From.GetHerHim] why this cannot be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_intrigue_1351;Refuse, but buy [From.GetHerHim] an estate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_intrigue_1351;Legitimize [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_emf_intrigue_1351;Acknowledge [From.GetHerHim] as a bastard of my dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1352;[From.GetTitledFirstName] shook his head. 'No,' he said. 'That is simply never going to happen. Put it out of your head.' Then he had me escorted from the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1352;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1352;This isn't right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1353;[From.GetTitledFirstName] listened to me for some time, and then he sat me down and we talked at length. He explained the political realities in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and why legitimizing me would complicate things. I'm disappointed, but I do see the truth in his words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1354;[From.GetTitledFirstName] listened to my plea for some time. While he ultimately did refuse to legitimize me, he offered me an estate off of which to live. It will make me a [Root.GetLordLady] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], but is that enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1354;No, it's not enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1355;'Know that I, [From.GetTitledName], hereby consider [Root.GetTitledFirstName] to be my legitimate child and to be considered such throughout [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. [Root.GetSheHeCap] will take [Root.GetHerHis] rightful place within the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty and among my heirs. By the grace of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] shall this be so.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1356;'Know that I, [From.GetTitledName], hereby acknowledge [Root.GetTitledFirstName] as my bastard child and a member of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty. [Root.GetSheHeCap] will take [Root.GetHerHis] rightful place within my house, though [Root.GetSheHe] will not number among my heirs. By the grace of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] shall this be so.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1361;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has inherited the [FromFrom.GetFullName], a title that should rightfully belong to me. I have the feeling that many of [From.GetHerHis] vassals would agree. Perhaps I should make my case to them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1361;[FromFrom.GetName] is rightfully mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1361;No, let [From.GetTitledFirstName] have it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1362;Word reaches you that your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has made a claim against your titles. [From.GetSheHeCap] is trying to win the support of your vassals, and it's possible some of them might actually agree with [From.GetHerHis] cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1362;Damn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1362;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in prison at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1363;Word reaches you that [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has made a claim against [From.GetTitledFirstName], claiming [FromFrom.GetSheHe] should rightfully have been the heir to the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. It is not uncommon for bastards to do this, and you suspect there are some who might agree with [FromFrom.GetHerHis] cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1363;I agree--[FromFrom.GetSheHe] should rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1363;No, I support [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1370;Recently, you discovered that [Root.Father.GetTitledFirstName] was never your father at all. Should you confront your real father and demand the truth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1370;I need to know;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1370;I am a [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName], and that's all that matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1371;[From.GetTitledFirstName] recently came to me, saying that [From.GetSheHe] recently learned that [From.Father.GetTitledFirstName] was not, in fact, [From.GetHerHis] real father. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] believes I am. It's true, of course, but now [From.GetSheHe] expects an answer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1371;Tell [From.GetHerHim] the truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1371;Deny it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_intrigue_1371;Convince [From.GetHerHim] it's not true;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1372;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sighed heavily when I confronted him, but eventually nodded. 'I can't be certain,' he admitted, 'but I was close to your mother once, and you were born during that time. You are my child.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1372;Then I want to be recognized as such;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1372;That's all I wanted to know;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1373;I asked [From.GetTitledFirstName] for the truth, and he looked me straight in the eye and said he wasn't my father. It's not true, of course, but obviously he will lie to my face about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1373;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1374;[From.GetTitledFirstName] appeared genuinely confused when I confronted him. 'I knew your mother once, it's true,' he admitted, 'but that's all. [Root.Father.GetTitledFirstName] is surely your father. You even have his look about you.' I felt embarrassed to have even brought it up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1374;I suppose I was mistaken;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1375;To my surprise, [From.GetTitledFirstName] merely nodded and turned to leave after I told [From.GetHerHim] the truth. 'I only wanted to hear it from your own lips,' [From.GetSheHe] said. I wonder if this is the last I will hear of it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1376;[From.GetTitledFirstName] nodded when I told [From.GetHerHim] the truth. 'Then recognize me. If I am truly your kin, I want to be known as such. I have rights, do I not?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1500_A;My spies believe they have collected enough information on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]'s comings and goings that my plot should now have a better chance of success, and indeed should happen more quickly than originally planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1500_B;My spies believe they have collected enough information on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]'s comings and goings that the plot against [target_spy_on.GetHerHim] should now have a much better chance of success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1501;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nMy people have been watching [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] for some time now, and we've acquired enough knowledge of [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] comings and going to help your plot against [target_spy_on.GetHerHim]. With luck, my information will see us to success.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1503;An interesting bit of information has surfaced from my spying on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]: years ago, the man had a torrid affair with [hidden_bastard_mother.GetBestName]. [hidden_bastard.GetFirstName] was later born, and everyone believed [hidden_bastard_father.GetBestName] was the father even though it was a lie...and you have the proof.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1505;An interesting bit of information has surfaced from my spying on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]: the man everyone believes to be [[target_spy_on.GetHerHis] father is not. [target_spy_on.GetHerHisCap] mother, [hidden_bastard_mother.GetTitledFirstName], once had a torried affair with [hidden_bastard_true_father.GetTitledName], and it is he who is [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]'s real father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1505;Blackmail [hidden_bastard_true_father.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1505;Reveal the truth for all to see;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_intrigue_1505;I have no interest in this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1506;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nIt has come to my attention that you are, in truth, the father of [hidden_bastard.GetBestName]. No, there is no need to deny it. I have several letters between yourself and [hidden_bastard_mother.GetBestName] in my possession. If you do not make it worth my time to keep them to myself, it will be most unfortunate.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1507;It seems you leave me no choice. To protect both my own reputation and that of [hidden_bastard.GetBestName], It seems I must do as you demand.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1508;You believe I am concerned that anyone might know of [hidden_bastard.GetTitledFirstName]'s true lineage? I have borne scandal before. Do your worst, fiend, you shall see no profit in this deed.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1508;Then it seems everyone must know the truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1508;Bah! Fair enough, I'll not go through with it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1509;News has been circulating throughout court that [hidden_bastard_father.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is not, in fact, your father. They say [hidden_bastard_true_father.GetBestName] is, and, true or not, it seems everyone believes the scandal. You have been declared a bastard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1509;How can this be??;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1510;News has been circulating throughout court that [hidden_bastard_father.GetBestName] is not, in fact, the father of [hidden_bastard.GetBestName]. [hidden_bastard_true_father.GetBestName] is, having once had a torried affair with [hidden_bastard_mother.GetBestName], the child kept a secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1510;Such a scandal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1515;My spies have uncovered some interesting information on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]: [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] was recently seen in the company of [target_revealed_lover.GetTitledName], and I'm assured the two of them are clearly lovers and have been for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1515;Blackmail [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1515;Blackmail [target_revealed_lover.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_intrigue_1515;Reveal them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_intrigue_1515;I have no interest in this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1516;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am aware of your affair with [target_revealed_lover.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. Unless you would like this knowledge to be made freely available to the world, I suggest you make my silence worthwhile, and soon.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1516_B;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am aware of your affair with [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. Unless you would like this knowledge to be made freely available to the world, I suggest you make my silence worthwhile, and soon.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1516;Pay [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1516;[From.GetSheHeCap] will get nothing from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1517;What you believe you know is barely worth clarifying. Here is coin enough to keep your silence, wretch, for I have not the time to deal with the scandal your wagging tongue would cause.\n\nTake it and go,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1519;Do your worst, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. I have not the time to spend on your imaginations, and certainly will not reward you for making threats.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1519;Reveal [From.GetHerHis] affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1519;Let the matter drop;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1525;Your spies have recently overheard [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] saying some rather unflattering things about [target_new_rival.GetTitledName]. Considering that [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] also has no love for [target_spy_on.GetHerHim], it might be possible to enflame a rivalry between the two without anyone being the wiser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1525;Make the attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_intrigue_1525;No, I don't want to risk it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1526;Success! A few rumors spread in the courts of both [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] have resulted in their mutual dislike blossoming into a new rivalry. Now all that remains is to see where this leads...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1527;You've never cared for [target_new_rival.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is constantly filled with rumors of the terrible things [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] has been saying about you. It is beyond the pale, and enough is enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1527;How dare [target_new_rival.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1528;You've never cared for [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is constantly filled with rumors of the terrible things [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] has been saying about you. It is beyond the pale, and enough is enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1528;How dare [target_spy_on.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1529;While you've filled the courts of both [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] with rumors, neither of them seems to have taken the bait. At best, they are irritated with each other. Thankfully, neither has clued into the fact that the rumors have come from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1530;You've never cared for [target_new_rival.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is filled with constant rumors regarding how much [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] dislikes you. Even so, you find it hard to credit this talk as more than just talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1530;I so despise court gossip;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1531;You've never cared for [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is filled with constant rumors regarding how much [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] dislikes you. Even so, you find it hard to credit this talk as more than just talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1532;Alas, while you've filled the courts of both [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] with rumors, neither appears to have taken the bait. Worse, their suspicions that someone is behind these rumors has been raised. Your hand may have been revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1533;You've never cared for [target_new_rival.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is constantly filled with rumors of the terrible things [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] has been saying about you. It turns out, however, that the rumors are false and come from [From.GetTitledName], who has been attempting to stir a rivalry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1533;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1534;You've never cared for [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is constantly filled with rumors of the terrible things [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] has been saying about you. It turns out, however, that the rumors are false and come from [From.GetTitledName], who has been attempting to stir a rivalry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1540;Your spies report that [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is not on good terms with [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] liege, [target_new_rival.GetTitledName]. Indeed, it might be possible to plant rumors and sour relations between them even further...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1541;Success! Rumors planted in the courts of both [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] have stirred up animosity between them both, with neither aware that you are the one responsible. Now it only remains to see what comes of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1542;While you have no great love for your liege, recently you've heard far too many rumors regarding how much [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] dislikes you. You were disinclined to believe them, but the way [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] glared at you at your last meeting has persuaded you otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1542;So that's how it is, is it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1543;While you have no great love for [target_spy_on.GetTitledName], you had no idea that [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] despised you so much until you began hearing rumors of [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] hateful comments. When you last saw [target_spy_on.GetHerHim] at court, the glares [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] shot your way confirmed your suspicions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1544;While you planted rumors in [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court regarding [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], they have been lost amidst all the hubbub of [target_new_rival.GetHerHis] daily duties and thus were ignored. Thankfully, neither [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] nor [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] are aware of your attempt to cause trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1545;Alas, while you planted rumors in [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court regarding [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], they have been mostly ignored...and, far worse, you believe they have begun to suspect your involvement in starting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1546;There have been far too many rumors lately regarding [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s supposed dislike of you...enough so that you were prompted to investigate, only to discover rumors that you hated [target_new_rival.GetHerHim] as well! The rumors were spread by [From.GetTitledName], who is evidently attempting to cause trouble between you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_intrigue_1546;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_intrigue_1547;There have been far too many rumors lately regarding [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s supposed dislike of you...enough so that you were prompted to investigate, only to discover rumors that you hated [target_spy_on.GetHerHim] as well!

EVTOPTG_WOL_200;I am a consort!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2071;My spies have revealed that [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] is behind a plot to [From.GetPlot]. They intercepted a message between [From.GetHerHim] and one of [From.GetHerHis] supporters, so I have proof of their plan in my very hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2071_B;My spies have revealed that [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] is part of a plot to [From.GetPlot], led by [From.GetTitledName]. They intercepted a message between the two, so I have proof of their plan in my very hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2071_C;My spies have revealed that [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] is part of a plot to [From.GetPlot] -- namely myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WOL_2072;How kind of [From.GetHerHim] to tell me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2100_DEVIANT;The most notable thing my spies have reported about [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] rather deviant sexual tastes. While it's not as if no-one knows of this, it would be a simple matter to enflame the rumors and ruin [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] reputation further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2100_DRUNK;The most notable thing my spies have reported about [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] his over-fondness for drink. Indeed, whispers in the court already call the [target_spy_on.GetManWoman] a drunkard. It would be a simple matter to enflame the rumors and ruin [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] reputation further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2100_DECADENT;The most notable thing my spies have reported about [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] complete decadence and lack of [target_spy_on.Religion.GetName] morality. This is a fact well-known to [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] court, but even so it would be a simple matter to enflame the rumors and ruin [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] reputation further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2100_BASTARD;The most notable thing my spies have reported about [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] illegitimate birth. It is a stain that will affect [target_spy_on.GetHerHim] forever, and thus it would be a simple matter to enflame the rumors and ruin [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] reputation further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2100_INSANE;The most notable thing my spies have reported about [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] complete and utter insanity. Indeed, many already wonder why [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] hasn't already been locked away, and thus it would be a simple matter to enflame the rumors and ruin [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] reputation further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_2100_HERETIC;The most notable thing my spies have reported about [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] lack of regard for the [target_spy_on.Religion.GetName] faith. Indeed, [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] cynical comments are well-known, and thus it would be a simple matter to enflame the rumors and ruin [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] reputation further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_2100_9;Spread the rumors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ZE_21904_age;While [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] had no doubt intended [introduced_heir.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to receive a more thorough education at court, the truth is that [introduced_heir.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is getting too old and set in [introduced_heir.GetHerHis] ways to still be groomed. [introduced_heir.GetHerHisCap] education is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZE_21905;The war means that [introduced_heir.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s education at court will have to wait. Hopefully [introduced_heir.GetSheHe] does not grow too old in the meantime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ZE_22900;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has finally introduced young [introduced_heir.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] at the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] court in [Root.Capital.GetName] as part of [Root.GetHerHis] continuing effort to groom the young [introduced_heir.GetManWoman] as [Root.GetHerHis] future heir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
