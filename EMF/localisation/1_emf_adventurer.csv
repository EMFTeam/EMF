convert_to_gothic_desc;A new Gothic culture has begun to form, born from the Norse of old. Perhaps the time has come to embrace it fully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_101;Word has reached me that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has begun a campaign to take the [target_adventurer_title.GetFullName], a title [From.GetSheHe] claims rightfully belongs to [From.GetHerHim], through force of arms. [From.GetSheHeCap] has begun touring the lands, trying to raise coin to hire mercenaries and drum up support for [From.GetHerHis] cause. Whether [From.GetSheHe] can succeed remains to be seen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_101;Oh dear, I hope [From.GetSheHe] is not prone to... accidents.;Oh là là, j'espère que [From.GetSheHe] n'est pas sujet(te) aux... accidents.;Oh weh, ich hoffe, [From.GetSheHe] ist nicht anfällig für… Unfälle.;;¡Dios mío, espero que [From.GetSheHe] no sea propenso a los... accidentes.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_115;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] recently arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], and has formally presented [From.GetHerHim]self at court: 'My [Root.GetLordLady], I am on a campaign to take my rightful titles within the [adventurer_target_title.GetFullName] from [adventurer_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. With your blessing, I wish to raise support here in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] for my growing army.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_115_vassal;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] recently arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], and has formally presented [From.GetHerHim]self at court: 'My [Root.GetLordLady], I am on a campaign to take my rightful titles within the [adventurer_target_title.GetFullName] from [adventurer_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], and have been given leave by [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to do so. With your blessing, I wish to raise support here in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] for my growing army.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_115;[From.GetSheHeCap] has my full support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_adventurer_115;[From.GetSheHeCap] may recruit in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_adventurer_115;Refuse and send [From.GetHerHim] away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_adventurer_115;Perhaps [adventurer_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] would pay a ransom for [From.GetHerHim]...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_116;News regarding [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]: [FromFrom.GetSheHe] continues to seek support in order to raise an army against you, and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] campaign has most recently brought [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], where [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has declared [From.GetHerHis] full support for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_116;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_adventurer_116;I don't need to be told [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s every movement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_117;News regarding [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]: [FromFrom.GetHerHis] campaign recently brought [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and while [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] did not offer personal support, [From.GetSheHe] did allow [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to look for recruits in the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_117;We'll see how far [FromFrom.GetSheHe] gets...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_118;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nAs you may have heard, I have been given leave by [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to seek support in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] for my campaign to retake my titles from [adventurer_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. If there is anything you can provide to support my cause, I would be forever grateful.\n\nSigned,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_118;Of course I will help [FromFrom.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_adventurer_118;Ignore [FromFrom.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_120;You were all smiles, welcoming [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] into your court...whether [FromFrom.GetSheHe] saw through you is uncertain, but regardless [FromFrom.GetSheHe] managed to escape from a trap you set on the road just outside of [Root.Capital.GetName] and has now fled [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_121;Success! You were all smiles as you welcomed [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] into your court, setting a trap for [FromFrom.GetHerHim] on the road just outside of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Your soldiers took [FromFrom.GetHerHim] prisoner, and already a message is off to [adventurer_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to inquire about a possible ransom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_122;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nA certain young [FromFrom.GetManWoman] who has been raising an army against you, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], foolishly came to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to beg for handouts. Currently [FromFrom.GetSheHe] resides in my dungeon, but I would be pleased to offer [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to you for a small ransom.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_122;Pay the ransom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_adventurer_122;[From.GetSheHeCap] may do with [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] as [From.GetSheHe] sees fit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_123;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nYour terms are most agreeable, and I thank you for your assistance in bringing [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to proper justice.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_124;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nWhile I would like [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to see proper justice, I cannot agree to your terms for ransom. Do with the [FromFromFrom.GetManWoman] as you see fit.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_124;Then [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] goes free, I suppose;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_adventurer_124;Perhaps someone else will pay for [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_131;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nAs you may have heard, I have begun a campaign to see my rightful titles restored to me, even if that means raising an army against [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstName]. Any assistance you can offer would be most welcome, and will be remembered.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_131;Of course I will help [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_adventurer_131;Ignore [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_132;According to your spies, [From.GetBestName] has thrown [From.GetHerHis] support to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], offering the [FromFrom.GetManWoman] a good deal of coin to support [FromFrom.GetHerHis] growing army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_132;A waste of coin, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_134;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], still campaigning to raise an army against you, is reportedly making good progress. Your [Root.GetSpymasterName] reports that [From.GetSheHe] is accompanied by several large mercenary bands lured with the promise of coin. At this rate, [From.GetSheHe] could potentially be ready to march within six months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_134;That's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_141;After years of trying and failing to raise an army large enough to challenge you, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has finally admitted defeat and given up on [From.GetHerHis] quest. [From.GetSheHeCap] remains in the [new_court_home.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], where [From.GetSheHe] will likely live out the remainder of [From.GetHerHis] life in obscurity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_141;Nice try, [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_142;Good news! At last report, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is bed-ridden in the [new_court_home.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] and barely able to speak...much less continue [From.GetHerHis] quest to raise an army against you. It appears [From.GetHerHis] threat to make good on [From.GetHerHis] claims against you are now much like [From.GetHerHis] mind: gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_142;I would feel bad for [From.GetHerHim], but...no;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_143;Considering [From.GetFirstName] is now the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and much too concerned with the day-to-day business of rulership, [From.GetHerHis] quest to raise an army against you has apparently been completely abandoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_143;So much for all those donations to [From.GetHerHis] cause, hm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_145;News has reached you of [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s death, thereby ending [From.GetHerHis] dream of taking [From.GetHerHis] claimed titles from you by force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_145;I won't say I'm sorry to hear that;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_148;The commander of the forces recruited to take your titles reports to you: 'We have served you long and well, my [Root.GetLordLady], but with the end to your wars so does our time of service end. We wish you well.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_148;It was good while it lasted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_161;Word has reached me that an ambitious adventurer, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is gathering men for some sort of attack on my territory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_161;I think of assassins...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_163;After years of careful planning, [From.GetDynName] has raised a large army of exiles, mercenaries and hopefuls, declaring [From.GetPossPronoun] intention to go off and carve out a realm of [From.GetPossPronoun] own...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_163;Well... good luck with that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_164;After years of careful planning, [FromFrom.GetDynName] from the court of [From.GetTitledName] has raised a large army of exiles, mercenaries and hopefuls, declaring [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] intention to go off and carve out a realm of [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] own...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_2500;For as long as we have ruled here in [Root.Capital.GetName], we have entrusted the raising of our children to local nursemaids. Our first words would not be [Root.Culture.GetName] but [melting_pot_province.Culture.GetName]. As we grew up, we learned to speak a tongue that was neither one nor the other but a syncretic mix of the two. Perhaps it is time to embrace this new tongue so we all may communicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_2500;We shall all be Norman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_adventurer_2500;No, I wish to remain [Root.Culture.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_2501;It seems that this new [new_culture.Culture.GetName] language has now spread into [Root.GetName], a new culture born from a mix of the old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_2502;Although many dislike change, this new [Root.Culture.GetName] language does have a certain functionality that cannot be denied. I have therefore prevailed upon a member of my court to adopt this for everyday administrative use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_adventurer_2751;The Invasion of Neustria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_2751;A Viking warrior by the name of [Root.GetFirstName] has collected a rather large band of followers over his years as a raider in the North Sea, and now rumor has it that he has set his sights on the northern coast of Neustria. Already citizens in the city of Rouen are panicking, fearing the imminent arrival of these barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_2751_immediate;A Viking warrior by the name of [Root.GetFirstName] has collected a rather large band of followers over his years as a raider in the North Sea, and now he has landed upon the northern coast of Neustria and siezed several of its castles and cities. Many fear this Norseman will use Rouen as a base from which to launch further raids and thus terrorize the entirety of northern Francia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_2751;Glory for the Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_adventurer_2751;They're coming *here*?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_2753;Ruling in a strange land has been difficult, but the longer you remain in [Root.Capital.GetName] the more you hear about this Christian God and His ways. Considering that, more and more, your court is beginning to take on the language and mannerisms of the Franks, perhaps it would be easier to accept this new religion than fight against it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_2753;I shall embrace this new God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_adventurer_2753;Never! My faith in Odin is absolute!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_2754;The war is not going well. Those within your war council have uneasily advised that perhaps the best route would be to kneel before [christian_liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and offer to accept the Christian faith. To not do so might mean the loss of everything you've attempted to build in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_2754;I will bend knee before this [christian_liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_adventurer_2754;Bend the knee? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_2755;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am not a fool. You will win this war in time, but I have a better solution: I offer my soldiers and my loyalty. I will bend the knee as your vassal and accept your [Root.Religion.GetName] faith as my own, if you will but spare my life and that of my court.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_2755_prisoner;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am your prisoner, and you may do with me what you wish -- but I offer you a better solution: my soldiers and my loyalty. I will bend the knee as your vassal and accept your [Root.Religion.GetName] faith as my own, if you will but spare my life and that of my court.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_2755;If he bends the knee, he may live;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_adventurer_2755;No -- the war continues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_adventurer_2756;[Root.GetFirstName] Surrenders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_2756;Facing an ignominious loss in his war against the Christians, [Root.GetTitledName] has bent the knee to [From.GetTitledName] and converted to the Christian faith. In truth, there are many who say the Norsemen of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have already taken on many [From.Culture.GetName] customs, and that this embracing of a new faith and liege was simply making official what was already in truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_adventurer_2756;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_adventurer_2756;So long as he is loyal, I am pleased;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_2757;There shall be no peace so long as you remain squatting on land where you do not belong.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_adventurer_2758;Now that you have converted, you are finally free to marry Poppa -- a consort captured at Bayeaux, and who you have been speaking with on matters of Christ for some time. Additionally, she has now born you a son and heir!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_2005;The people of [Root.GetName] have developed their language and customs to a point where they may now be considered part of a distinct branch of Norse culture. They have begun to refer to themselves as Icelandic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_2005;What will they think of next, I wonder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_2005;Welcome into the fold, my Icelandic brothers and sisters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_2006;The people of [Root.GetName] have developed their language and customs to a point where they may now be considered part of a distinct branch of Norse culture. They have begun to refer to themselves as Gothic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
