# Former religion head was sacrificed by other faith
emf_crier.50.title;The [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle] is Dead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_norse_killer;[FromFrom.GetFirstName], the former head of the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith, hangs from a branch, [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] lifeless eyes bulging. Some children steal [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] preposterous hat and laugh as they pass it around. Overhead ravens are already circling, preparing for their own part in the feast.\n\nWhat will the other [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s think when they learn of this glorious victory for your faith, when they learn you have killed their spiritual leader? Will they shake with fear at the sound of the Allfather's name? As you ponder these questions, the ravens descend and begin their bloody work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_norse_faith;[Root.GetBestName] has sacrificed the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle] at a Blot. Even now the so-called holy [FromFrom.GetManWoman] hangs from a tree branch, [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] corpse torn by ravens.\n\nDoes this auspicious occasion mean the eventual triumph of your [Root.Religion.GetName] faith? Or will the other [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s be inspired to strike back against those they hold responsible?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_hindu_killer;The body of the former [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle] lies on the temple floor, its throat cut. The collected blood has already been passed around among the guests and many have tasted it, their lips unnaturally red, chins flecked, mustaches dripping. The statue of Kali looms over everything, including the corpse of poor [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. Kali's expression is, as always, one of rage—her eyes fierce, her mouth ready to devour.\n\nWill the other [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s tremble in fear when they learn of this act? Will they be humbled, as they should be? And will Kali see fit to spare any soul, even yours? With these thoughts swirling in your mind, you take the skull cup, still full of blood, and set it to your lips...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_hindu_faith;[Root.GetBestName] has sacrificed the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle] at a Kali Puja feast. At this moment the so-called holy [FromFrom.GetManWoman] lies dead, [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] throat cut, [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] blood served to guests.\n\nIs this momentous occasion proof that your [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is superior? Or will the other [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s find a new motivation to wage war against those they hold responsible?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_zun_killer;[FromFrom.GetFirstName], once the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle], has succumbed to the judgment of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. [FromFrom.GetPossPronounCap] lifeless body, still in the sand where [FromFrom.GetSubjectPronoun] was half-buried, is burned red, [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] lips dried and cracked. Flies swarm about [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] exposed head. Vultures watch from nearby perches, waiting for their chance at the corpse.\n\nThrough this act, it appears as though [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] has actually delivered judgment upon all the other [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s. How else could such an event be interpreted? Why did their [FromFrom.Religion.GetHighGodName] not deliver this supposed holy [FromFrom.GetManWoman]? And truly, how bright can their god be compared to the Sun itself? With these thoughts in your mind, you retreat and let the desert scavengers do what they will...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_zun_faith;[Root.GetBestName] has submitted the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle] to the judgment of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], and the Sun has not been merciful. The so-called holy [FromFrom.GetManWoman] is dead, [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] corpse picked apart by desert scavengers.\n\nDoes this mean [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] will lead you to victory against the other [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s? Or will the heathens instead muster their armies and do battle with those they hold responsible?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_aztec_killer;The body of [FromFrom.GetFirstName], the [FromFrom.GetManWoman] who called [FromFrom.GetReflexivePronoun] the [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle], rolls down the temple steps and comes to a stop in a broken heap. A trail of blood marks the path of [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] descent. At the top of the temple a [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] stands with a human heart in one hand and an obsidian knife in the other, both still dripping blood. Mighty [Root.Culture.GetName] warriors cheer at the sight, comforted by the knowledge that [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will subsist and the heavens will keep turning.\n\nWill these [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] weaklings now cower in fear at the might of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]? Or will they persist in their struggles against you? Either way, you know many of them will meet the same fate as their [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_aztec_faith;[Root.GetBestName] has sacrificed the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle] to the Gods. The supposed holy [FromFrom.GetManWoman] lies at the foot of an [Root.Religion.GetName] temple, [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] heart cut from [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] chest.\n\nAnd yet it is not enough—many others must be sacrificed, if the cosmos is to be sustained. The other [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s will surely resist your efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_sacrifice;Word has arrived that a [GetFromRootInsult] by the name of [Root.GetBestName] has captured [FromFrom.GetBestName] and then sacrificed [FromFrom.GetObjectPronoun] at a heathen ritual. While you don't know the details of it, the monstrousness of the action is clear. The former [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle] has been debased, desecrated, used like an animal.\n\nWhy has [FromFrom.Religion.GetHighGodName] allowed this to happen? Is this evidence that all [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s have been forsaken? Surely something must be done about these barbaric [Root.Religion.GetName]s. Such a profane act cannot go unpunished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_group;Word has arrived that a [GetFromRootInsult] by the name of [Root.GetBestName] has captured [FromFrom.GetBestName] of the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith and sacrificed [FromFrom.GetObjectPronoun] at a barbaric ritual. While it doesn't directly concern your own faith, it is still a worrying development.\n\nAre any good [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s safe from these foreign predations? Who else will be made victims of profane rites performed for heathen gods? Perhaps something must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.desc_other;Rumors spreading through your realm say that a [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] [FromFrom.RelHead.GetTitle] has been taken prisoner and was recently sacrificed at a ritual by [Root.GetBestName]. If true, it may signal the growing power of the [Root.Religion.GetName] people and the waning of the [FromFrom.Religion.GetGroupName]s. How powerful can they be, if they cannot protect their spiritual leaders?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.a;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.b;Let them try. [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] is with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.c;[FromFrom.Religion.GetHighGodName] defend us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.d;These [Root.Religion.GetName] folk might be trouble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.50.e;[FromFrom.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] fails them once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Announce new empire
emf_crier.251.title;Founding of an Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.251.desc_owner;Your realm stretches from horizon to horizon. The armies you command have crushed all foes. The prosperity of your people is undeniable. Clearly you are favored by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], and it seems fitting and just that you should be called [FromFrom.GetRulerTitle] of [FromFrom.GetBaseName] and exalted above other rulers.\n\nThere will surely still be challenges ahead, but under your leadership the [Root.Culture.GetName] people enter a new age. Whether that age is one of further glory or ultimate destruction will be determined by your guiding hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.251.desc_owner_catholic;With the undeniable might of your realm and the flourishing of your people as the justification, you have named yourself [FromFrom.GetRulerTitle] of [FromFrom.GetBaseName]. No one dares question your power in the earthly domain.\n\nBut even now many are whispering of the boldness, and perhaps even the presumption, of naming yourself as such. Are you deserving of such a title? Is that not for God to decide? What does the Holy Father say? Without Papal blessing, it may be difficult to convince even your own loyal subjects of your right to call yourself [FromFrom.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.251.desc_other_catholic;[Root.GetDynName] has declared [Root.GetReflexivePronoun] to be [FromFrom.GetRulerTitle] of [FromFrom.GetBaseName]. It is surely good news that such a mighty Catholic power has risen in this troubled world, and its success may imply that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] favors it. But while its might cannot be questioned, claiming the title of Emperor seems a presumptuous move when the Pope has not offered his assent or blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.251.desc_other_samerel;[Root.GetDynName] has declared [Root.GetReflexivePronoun] to be [FromFrom.GetRulerTitle] of [FromFrom.GetBaseName]. It is surely good news that such a mighty [Root.Religion.GetName] power has risen in this troubled world, and its success may imply that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] favors it. Perhaps this is the beginning of a new and glorious era for the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.251.desc_other_samegroup;[Root.GetDynName] has declared [Root.GetReflexivePronoun] to be [FromFrom.GetRulerTitle] of [FromFrom.GetBaseName]. The [Root.Religion.GetName] faith now has a mighty representative in the earthly domain. But whether they will be good allies to their fellow [Root.Religion.GetGroupName]s remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.251.desc_other_difgroup;[Root.GetDynName], a heathen [Root.Religion.GetName], has declared [Root.GetReflexivePronoun] the so-called [FromFrom.GetRulerTitle] of [FromFrom.GetBaseName]. Even though he makes a mockery of the very title itself, his power is undeniable. All [This.Religion.GetGroupName]s would do well to be cautious and avoid underestimating this new rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.251.a;May our future reign be glorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.251.b;I'm sure Papal approval is a mere formality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.251.c;Surely the Pope must be consulted?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.251.d;Fantastic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.251.e;At least we believe in the same God?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.251.f;This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Announce new kingdom
# Announce empire destruction
emf_crier.253.title;End of an Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.253.desc;Whether by external pressures or internal corruption, the [emf_crier_dead_title.GetFullName] has been reduced to a remnant of its former glory. No longer seen as a true empire by others, nor able to deem itself as such without risking blasphemy, it has succumbed to its weakness and is forfeit.\n\n[From.GetDynName], the former [From.GetEmperorEmpress], has surrendered [From.GetPossPronoun] imperial crown and accepted the lesser title [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.253.desc_hre;Charlemagne's once great empire has submitted to a final, inglorious fate and is undone. The dream of reviving the Roman Empire in the West has ended in the same decline and ultimate destruction as befell the Romans of old.\n\n[From.GetDynName], the [From.GetManWoman] who once claimed the [emf_crier_dead_title.GetFullName] as [From.GetPossPronoun] own, has been reduced to [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName]—an ignoble fate for the last successor of Charles the Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.253.desc_byz;The Empire of the Romans has fallen! Considered by many to be the inheritor and keeper of the legacy of the Roman Empire, and once surely the foremost bastion of Christendom in the East, the [emf_crier_dead_title.GetFullName] is no more.\n\nWith the Empire broken and Constantinople in the hands of another realm, the former [From.GetEmperorEmpress], [From.GetDynName], has given up [From.GetPossPronoun] imperial throne and become [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.253.a;I should send [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] my sympathies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.253.b;Surely a great misfortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.253.c;Good riddance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_crier.253.d;Perhaps I can turn this to my advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
