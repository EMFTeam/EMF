EVTOPTA_emf_tournament_121;I will prepare for battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_tournament_121;How exciting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_150;As [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] skillfully plunged [tournament_opponent.GetHerHis] blade into my belly and I fell on my back, I reflected briefly on the unfairness of the universe. Then I focused on my fading heartbeat as the blue sky above turned darker and darker...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_tournament_150;An honorable way to die;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_151;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] squared off against [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] in the grand melee, and when [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] was struck a heavy blow to the head the dull crack could be heard from across the field. The audience hushed in shock, and it was soon clear that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] was not going to get up again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_151_nomad;The war games are going well, and on-lookers cheer with excitement when [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] ride at each other on the field. The ring of steel on steel is soon replaced with shocked gasps from the crowd as [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] slips and is all but impaled on [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s blade. It is clearly a mortal wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_151_muslim;At first, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] appeared equally matched. Then, as the Furusiyya crowd watched, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s horse started and [From.GetSheHe] awkwardly flew out of [From.GetHerHis] saddle when [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s saber struck. It was quickly clear [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] was not going to get up again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_tournament_151;A blow well struck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_tournament_151;I don't need to be told of every death...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_tournament_151;[From.GetSheHeCap] should have been quicker;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_152;The melee was going well when the [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s mace came crashing down upon me, I managed to block it but my shield shatter under the force of [tournament_opponent.GetHerHis] blow. The next swing came crashing down and the darkness overtook me. I am out of the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_152_nomad;My horse bucked wildly to the side as [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] rushed past on [tournament_opponent.GetHerHis] steed, and I was thrown to the ground. When my senses finally returned, I felt nothing but searing pain and I heard the shouting of on-lookers rushing to my aid. My injuries, however, cannot match my shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_152_muslim;My horse bucked wildly to the side as [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] rushed past on [tournament_opponent.GetHerHis] camel, and I was thrown to the ground. When my senses finally returned, I felt nothing but searing pain and I heard the shouting of the crowd. It appears I have been badly defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_153;The crowd roars with approval as [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] squares off against [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] in the grand melee. Blow after blow is struck, steel ringing on steel, until finally [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] lands a solid hit and [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] reels and falls. [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] exults in [tournament_opponent.GetHerHis] victory, but it's clear [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is severely injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_153_nomad;A group of warriors clash during the war games, individuals pairing off against each other, but it's clear [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] are the standouts. They battle to a standstill until finally [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] gets a blow in which [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will clearly never recover from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_153_muslim;The clash of arms between [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] seems almost personally. Both are skilled, and their display sets the watching crowd on fire. Finally it is [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] who gets the opening, and [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] goes down screaming in a fountain of blood. The watching crowd roars its approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_tournament_153;That is a *lot* of blood...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_tournament_153;I don't need to hear about every injury;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_tournament_153;At least [tournament_opponent.GetSheHe] got up again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_154;I sought out a worthy foe in the grand melee, and when [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] came upon me I parried [tounament_opponent.GetHerHis] first thrust. The follow up was too quick for me, however, and a jolt of pain shot through my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_154_nomad;I sought out a worthy foe in the war games, and when [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] came upon me on [tounament_opponent.GetHerHis] horse I parried the first thrust of  [tounament_opponent.GetHerHis] bade. The follow up was far too quick for me, however, and a jolt of pain shot through my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_154_muslim;I was facing an opponent in a game of chess, and while pondering my opening moves, the game next to ours turned violent. [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] hurled the board aside to pull out [tournament_opponent.GetHerHis] scimitar, sending chess pieces flying everywhere. One of White's Bishops struck me in the eye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_155;One of the grand melee's highlights was watching [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] trade blows for almost ten minutes. They were both nearly exhausted when finally [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] shattered [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s shield with a powerful blow and sent the [From.GetManWoman] flying back. [From.GetSheHeCap] is injured and has been knocked out of the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_155_nomad;One of the war games' highlights was watching [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] trade blows with spears for almost ten minutes after having been knocked from their horses. They were both nearly exhausted when finally [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] threw [tournament_opponent.GetHerHis] spear in a desperate gamble and it hit home, sending the [From.GetManWoman] flying back. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is injured and has been knocked out of the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_155_muslim;One of the Furusiyya's highlights was watching [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [tournament_opponent.GetOnlyDynastyName] trade artful scimitar blows for almost ten minutes. They were both nearly exhausted when finally [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] shattered [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s blade and sent the [From.GetManWoman] flying back. [From.GetSheHeCap] is injured and has been eliminated from the competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_tournament_155;Well done, [tournament_opponent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_tournament_155;It was a gamble that paid off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_156;We advanced forth into the grand melee, but then I saw our foes and suddenly my bowels loosened and guts turned to water. My comrades all looked on me in disgust, and to this day I truly cannot account for this terror...but it has not left me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_156_nomad;To my shame, I spent most of the war games hidden away and avoiding coming into contact with the other fighters. Some of the on-lookers noticed my reticence and began taunting me, and yet even then all I could do was sit on my horse and let my face redden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_156_muslim;To my great shame, the challenge of keeping my bowels in check during the martial competition proved too much for me. I fled home to escape the taunts of my former comrades and for a change of underwear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_157;The melee was fought and I went boldly forth, while other stood back I charged forth headless of my own safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_157_nomad;Suddenly, in the middle of a frenzied charge, a lone spearman thundered towards you on his horse. You waited until exactly the right moment, batted away his spear, and then leapt across to his horse and pushed him off in one smooth motion. It was a feat of bravery that has been the talk of the realm ever since.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_157_muslim;Suddenly, in the middle of a frenzied melee, the crowds part to reveal a giant swordsman grinning at you. After he shows off some fancy moves with his sword, the crowds turn expectantly to you. You fling a dagger into the thug's throat and he drops dead to the wild cheers of those nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_158;People felt my leadership skills were poor, some even called me misguided.  Then the tide of the melee turned...but in the heat of battle it was my voice which rose above the others and my direction which turned the tide once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_158_muslim;There were many who doubted my fighting ability, but when we rode our horses into mock battle only to be ambushed by our opponents, I was the one who led us to victory against all odds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_159;I have been long renowned for my roughness, but in the recent grand melee the enemy took us by surprise and yet I still lead from the front and steered us to victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_159_muslim;As we rode our horses into battle in yet another test of skill, I devised a clever ambush against our opponents. We prevailed despite being outnumbered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_160;The grand melee was challenging and my skills were renowned. Our valiant foes had prepared well, but if it weren't for a moment of brilliance by myself they would have triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_160_nomad;The war games were challenging and my skills were put to the ultimate test. Our valiant foes had prepared well, but if it weren't for a moment of brilliance by myself they would have triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_160_muslim;Many believe that chess is the ultimate test of strategy, and if this is true, your brilliance as a general is undeniable. All who have mustered the courage to challenge you in this game have met with defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_161;I am known for my brilliance but the enemy had developed a counter, claiming that I relied on only a few simple strategies and was too inflexible to think on my feet. Perhaps they were right. Word has spread and my brilliance is diminished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_161_muslim;You are renowned for your skills in strategy and planning, but several defeats in mock battles due to embarrassing mistakes on your part have put this reputation into question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_162;My skills on the battlefield are well known, but it seems there is a counter to my strategies...and far too many here at the grand melee have heard about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_162_nomad;My skills on the battlefield are well known, but it seems there is a counter to my strategies...and far too many here at the war games have heard about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_162_muslim;No matter how hard you try, you cannot wrap your head around this stupid game called chess...a game of which you'd thought yourself to be a master. Your opponents at the Furusiyya always seem to be several moves ahead of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_163;In a recent melee the toughness I habitually show has been proven to be misguided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_163_muslim;After repeatedly falling off my horse during a competitive event, many have questioned my abilities as a warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_164;I was taking part in the tournament and enjoying the camaraderie when I found myself entranced with an utterly captivating sparring partner. I told myself it was nothing, but now I find myself glancing at other men and contemplating strange thoughts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_164_nomad;I was taking part in the war games and enjoying the camaraderie when I found myself entranced with an utterly captivating horseman. I told myself it was nothing, but now I find myself glancing at other men and contemplating strange thoughts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_164_muslim;Though I did not participate myself, I felt particularly drawn to the wrestling challenges of the Furusiyya...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_165;Tournaments are such fun, and full of entertainments of every kind and description. Then I noticed a strange sore on my body in a place I would much rather not mention, and it all didn't seem quite as fun any longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_tournament_166;To be honest, I'm not quite certain how my time at the grand tournament went. At some point drinks were pressed into my hands, and there was much merriment and laughing and it all became blurred. When it was over a few mornings later I felt terrible and the hair of the dog seemed like the answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_tournament_166_muslim;To be honest, I'm not quite certain how my time at the grand tournament went. At some point wine was pressed into my hands, and there was much merriment and laughing and it all became blurred. When it was over a few mornings later, I desired more even though it is haram, forbidden. Surely a few more drops cant hurt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_167;While I was at the tournament some lower class type with pretensions insulted my honor. I could only do what a [Root.GetManWoman] of my class could do and challenged him to a duel. Naturally he was no match for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_tournament_167_muslim;A fighter had the nerve to insult me in front of several of the other attending warriors. The look on his face when I challenged him to a duel revealed him for the coward he was, but honor left him no choice but to accept.
