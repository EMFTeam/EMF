emf_customize_ruler;Customize Ruler Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_customize_ruler_desc;If selected using the Ruler Designer, you will be able to select any character of your culture and assign their relation to you, if one is valid, or just assume their dynasty as a 'distant relation', provided you are not also a bastard (in which case you will keep your current dynasty). To do so, right-click on their portrait and select the 'Assume Dynasty' decision in their diplomatic menu. You will have the option to back out, if you so choose, and you may only use this option within the first 15 days of the game. After that, the trait is useless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_customize_ruler_dynasty;Set As Relative;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_customize_ruler_dynasty_desc;If you proceed, you will be prompted to select your relation to [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], if a relation is valid, which will mean assuming [Root.GetHerHis] dynasty (unless you are a bastard). This includes being a 'distant relative', in which case you will only assume [Root.GetHerHis] dynasty. You will have the chance to back out of the decision, if you so desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_clear_child_focus;Clear Childhood Focus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_clear_child_focus_desc;If you have ruled for less than a year, you may clear the focus of any children in your court once (and once only).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
