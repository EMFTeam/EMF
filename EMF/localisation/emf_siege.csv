emf_siege.105.desc_city;I am walking in the streets of [FromFromFrom.GetName] and enjoying the bustle of the city when from a distance I hear the sounds of battle and cries of terrified folk. Before I can decide of a course of action, a group of rough looking men surround me. Their weapons are raised and no few of them are covered in the blood of my people. One of them gestures towards me, obviously ordering me to submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.105.desc_temple;Is it even possible for a player to get captured in a raid on a temple? If so, and you're seeing this, feel free to report the situation on the HIP forums. AnaxXiphos would very much like to know, so he can write some proper flavor for this unusual occurrence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Looters captured a bishop of their own religion
emf_siege.106.desc;A [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] recently captured during one of my raids is petitioning me for [FromFromFrom.Holder.GetPossPronoun] release. [FromFromFrom.Holder.GetSubjectPronounCap] argues that because we are of the same [Root.Religion.GetName] faith [FromFromFrom.Holder.GetPossPronoun] imprisonment is a crime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.106.a_neutral;Perhaps [FromFromFrom.Holder.GetSubjectPronoun] is correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.106.a_cynical;What crime? Still, others might disapprove.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.106.a_zealous;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] forgive me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.106.b_neutral;Then again, perhaps not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

emf_siege.106.b_zealous;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] will deliver [FromFromFrom.Holder.GetObjectPronoun], if willing. But not I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Non-tribal raiders looted a church of their own faith
emf_siege.121.desc_present;Blood washes the floor, and we track it everywhere as we slaughter the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s and their servants. Soon the temple is set aflame, and the fire rises and trails black smoke above our heads as we carry off the spoils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.121.desc_distant;A courier arrives and informs me that one of my raiding parties has pillaged a church of our own [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Though I was not personally present, I will surely be held responsible for the actions of my soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.121.a_neutral;Perhaps I should reconsider this practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.121.a_cynical;If they hadn't resisted, they wouldn't have been slain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### For Events
# Defender choice event
emf_siege.1.a_tt;With no family to slow [This.GetObjectPronoun] down, §Y[This.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! will have better odds of escaping.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.1.c_tt;§Y[This.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! will have better odds of escape, but [This.GetPossPronoun] family will be very angry at being abandoned.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.1.d_tt;Attempting escape together makes it less likely §Y[This.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! or any of [This.GetPossPronoun] family will be successful.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.1.e_tt;Staying behind to defend will give §Y[This.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s§! family better odds of escaping.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.1.g_tt_family;Your regent §Y[This.Regent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! will (probably) help you and your family to escape.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.1.g_tt_alone;Your regent §Y[This.Regent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! will (probably) help you to escape.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.1.h_tt;§Y[This.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! will attempt to escape with [This.GetPossPronoun] family.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
emf_siege.1.i_tt;With no family or regent to give better advice, §Y[This.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! will stay behind to defend against the siege. This is probably not a good idea.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Choices for other rulers present at siege
emf_siege.8.a_tt;Because §Y[This.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! is by [This.GetReflexivePronoun], [This.GetSubjectPronoun] will have better odds of escaping.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### For Decisions
