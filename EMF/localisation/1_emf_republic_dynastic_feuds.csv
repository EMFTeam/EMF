EVTDESC_REP_100;The [feud_victim.GetOnlyDynastyName] family has been very annoying as of late, and I think it is time to teach them a lesson. A grand ball is being planned in my honor next week, and as a practical joke, I plan on inviting everyone but the [feud_victim.GetOnlyDynastyName]s!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_100;This will put them in their place for sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_REP_106;The Unexpected Guest;L'invité inattendu;Der unerwartete Gast;;El invitado inesperado;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_106;The ball was going splendid until an unexpected guest showed up. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] burst into the family palace with [From.GetHerHis] entourage, apparently making [From.GetHerHis] way past the posted guards before they could block [From.GetHerHis] way. The music and laughter that previously permeated the palace all seemed to die out the moment [From.GetSheHe] stepped inside. Hushed whispers are all that can be heard as everyone's eyes seem to focus on [From.GetHerHim].\n\n"[From.GetTitledFirstName]!" you call out as you emerge from the crowd with a smile on your face. "How kind of you to join us. May I see your invitation?" As [From.GetSheHe] struggles for words, guards surround [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] party. "No invitation? That's a shame." With a small wave, the guards drag them all outside and throw them down the stairs of the entrance. You grin down at [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] as he lies on [From.GetHerHis] back in the dirt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_106;Ha ha ha, what fun! Now, back to the party...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_REP_107;The Even Greater Ball;Un bal encore plus grandiose;Der noch größere Ball;;Un baile aún mayor;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_107;[From.GetTitledName] will soon be hosting a great ball in [From.GetHerHis] family palace, and every patrician family in the republic has been invited - except for yours. Your dynasty's relation with the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family have only gotten worse since the practical joke you pulled on them with your own ball. The decision not to invite [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] members to the ball can only be seen as a grave insult.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_107;Grace the ball with my presence, invitation or not.;Honore le bal de m présence, qu'il y ait eu invitation ou non.;Schmücke den Ball mit meiner Anwesenheit, Einladung hin oder her.;;Honres al baile con mi presencia, con invitación o sin ella.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_REP_108;Arriving at the Ball...;L'arrivée au bal...;Beim Ball;;Al llegar al baile...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_108;The day of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] grand ball has arrived and everyone of importance in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] is invited... everyone but my family, that is. Anticipating that [From.GetSheHe] will have [From.GetHerHis] guards on the lookout for you, you decide to don a disguise before sneaking in with the crowd.\n\nAs you settle in and mingle with the guests, you cannot help but loudly and unfavorably compare this ball with your previous one. Out of nowhere, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] rushes at you and rips your disguise from your face and exclaims, "YOU!"\n\nAstonished, you push [From.GetHerHim] aside and make a mad dash for the exit like a frightened rabbit while shoving several dancing guests to the floor. Outside, you decide to head home, humiliated.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_108;You will live to regret this, [From.GetFirstName]! Mark my words!;Vous allez le regretter toute votre vie, [From.GetFirstName] ! Prenez-en note !;"Das werdet Ihr mir büßen, [From.GetFirstName]! Merkt Euch meine Worte!";;¡Vivirás para lamentarlo, [From.GetFirstName]! ¡Recuerda estas palabras!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_156;I decided to unveil the new [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship today, at the annual Marriage of the Sea ceremony where the maritime dominance of Venice is celebrated. I even invited [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] himself to oversee the ceremony from the great ship. As a long procession of ships sail through the city canals, the Pope drops one of his rings into the water and proclaims, "We wed thee, sea, in the sign of..." \n\nBefore he can finish the sentance, the galley lurches and begins to tip over! Both the Pope and I are thrown overboard, but we are soon fished out of the water by some nearby gondoliers. The Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church wrings out his drenched robes while launching a long tirade of profanity directed at me, as I turn red with embarassment.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_156;Oh dear...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_REP_157;The Flagship;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_157;Today was the grand unveiling of the new [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship, and nobles from all over [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] have gathered at the docks to watch as the mighty vessel is put to sea. You are beaming with pride, especially when you spot [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] in the crowd. Before long, the sleek vessel slides into the water and hoists its sails who are adorned with the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family crest.\n\nSuddenly the great galley snaps in half with a terrible crack! The crowd gasps in stunned silence, but you know exactly who is responsible: [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]! You turn to face [From.GetHerHim] immediately, your eyes glowing with fury. "YOU! This was YOUR doing!" you scream at [From.GetHerHim]. With a howl you attempt to hurl himself at [Root.GetHerHim], but [Root.GetHerHis] struggling aides hold you back. "I don't know how you did it, [From.GetFirstName], but I swear you will pay for this! Do you hear me, [Root.GetFirstName]?!";;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_REP_157;YOU WILL PAY!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_158;The new [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship was launched today, and you decided to ride it on its maiden voyage. In the distance, you spot [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] riding on a galley roughly half the size of your new flagship, and you decide to show off. As your flagship sweeps past dangerously close to the galley, it sends a large wave sweeping over the deck that knocks [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] off [From.GetHerHis] feet.\n\nAs [From.GetSheHe] stands up, drenched from top to bottom, you cackle at [From.GetHerHim] from the deck of your ship and stand by the railing looking down at [From.GetHerHim] with a smug grin on your face. "Well, well, if it isn't [From.GetTitledFirstName]! How are you doing down there? You should take better care when sailing in waters trafficked by larger vessels. I would hate for an accident to occur...";;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_REP_159;A Flagship Saved;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_REP_159;The new [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship is almost ready, though there was a minor hitch that delayed construction. Apparently, some men were sent by [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to sabotage it to embarass you on the day of its unveiling. Thankfully, they were caught in time and are now scheduled to be executed in front of the public. As a way to get back at [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], you make sure he is invited and will attend the execution. On the day of the execution, you spot [From.GetHerHim] in the crowd as you take to the stage to address the public.\n\n"My friends, take a long, hard look at these men," you begin. "They are enemies of the Republic and together they conspired to sabotage the construction of the new [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship. Fortunately, they were caught in the act and it has been revealed that they were not acting alone..." You give [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] a long glance and you think [From.GetSheHe] realizes where this is going.;;;;;;;;;x
