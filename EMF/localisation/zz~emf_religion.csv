#
adoptionist;Adoptionist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adoptionist_DESC;Adoptionists reject the Holy Trinity, believing that Jesus Christ was adopted as God's son at his ascension, chosen because of his sinless devotion to the will of God. They do not revere the Holy Mary, and were declared a Christian heresy at the end of the 2nd Century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apostolic;Apostolic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apostolic_DESC;Sometimes referred to as 'Gregorian', this was one of the early Christian faiths founded in Armenia by the Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus. It split from orthodox Christianity in the 6th century as a matter of Christology -- they are miaphysite, believing Christ to be of one incarnate nature, where both divine and human nature are united.\n§Y*§! Apostolics only recognize the three Petrine Sees\n§Y*§! Apostolics may choose between the Alexandrite and Antiochian schools of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arian;Arian;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arian_DESC;Arianism is a nontrinitarian belief that asserts that Jesus Christ is a Son of God, created by God the Father, distinct from the Father and therefore subordinate to the Father. It denies that Jesus is God the Son. The Ecumenical First Council of Nicaea of 325 AD deemed it to be a heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haruri;Haruri;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
haruri_DESC;The Haruri are a sect from the period of the Four Rightly-Guided Caliphs, named for their first leader, Habib ibn-Yazid al-Haruri. The Haruri were originally one branch of the Khariji 'Rejectors' movement, so called because they rejected Ali's right to the Caliphate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili;Isma'ili;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili_DESC;The Isma'ilis believe that, when the 6th Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq died, his true successor was not Musa al-Kazim as the others believe, but in fact was the already dead Isma'il and his son Muhammad. The line of Isma'il has been in hiding for years, but now has emerged to reclaim the Caliphate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mahdiyya;Mahdite;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mahdiyya_DESC;The Mahdites believe that the messiah, or Mahdi, has already risen, and given his commandments that clarify the Qur'an such that no other interpretation is valid. They are led by their own Caliphate of successors to the Mahdi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandaean;Mandaean;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandaean_DESC;Mandaeism is a gnostic religion with a strongly dualistic worldview. Its adherents revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enosh, Noah, Shem, Aram and especially John the Baptist, but reject Abraham, Moses and Jesus of Nazareth. It is represented in-game as an early form of Manichaeism, and a potential heresy should it resurface.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maronite;Maronite;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maronite_DESC;Beginning as a movement founded by the monk Maron in the fourth century, the Maronites are a Christian Church in full communion with the Holy See yet under the leadership of the Maronite Primate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_DESC;The Messalians, or Euchites ('Those who Pray'), are a heretical Christian sect that originated in Mesopotamia, influenced by dualistic faiths like Zoroastrianism. Messalians believe that God can be perceived by the carnal senses, and that this perception is necessary to reach perfection. Each person is born with an inner demon, and only intense prayer can drive it out. They also believe that Lucifer is the elder son of God and a force for good, and that incest is sacred since it was practised by the children of Adam and Eve. They have no formal rites and no strict church hierarchy. Features:\n§Y*§! Messalians must pray to expel their personal demons\n§Y*§! Once the demons are driven out, they can achieve the status of Perfection\n§Y*§! Messalians may choose a patron saint to worship\n§Y*§! Messalians can create their own Holy Order, the Army of Lucifer\n§Y*§! The Patriarch of Antioch will automatically become the new religion head\n§Y*§! Messalians only recognize the Petrine Sees;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
miaphysite;Coptic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
miaphysite_DESC;Copts are miaphysite, stressing that Christ had but a single nature, but of both human and divine character. This stance split them off from the main branch of Christianity after the council of Chalcedon in 451. Though not viewed as outright heretics by Orthodox and Catholic Christians, it is a fine distinction. The nominal head of the Coptic Church is the Pope of Alexandria.\n§Y*§! Copts only recognize the three Petrine Sees\n§Y*§! Copts may opt to become Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers instead of monks and nuns\n§Y*§! Copts may choose between the Alexandrite and Antiochian schools of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monophysite_DESC;Monophysitism is an early Christian heresy which states that Christ had but a single nature. This is the opposite of the Nestorian position where Christ has two separate natures - one divine and one human. The nominal head of the Monophysite Church is the Monophysite Pope of Alexandria.\n§Y*§! Monophysites only recognize the three Petrine Sees\n§Y*§! Monophysites may opt to become Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers instead of monks and nuns\n§Y*§! Monophysites may choose between the Alexandrite and Antiochian schools of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nabawiyya;Nabawite;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nabawiyya_DESC;The Nabawites believe that the Qur'an was only the holy book for the Arabs, and that they have their own holy book and prophet, just as legitimate, sent by God for their people, modelled on Islam. They are led by a Malik, similar to the Muslim Caliph.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paulician_DESC;Paulicianism is Christian Gnostic heresy influenced by Manichaeism, originating in Armenia, and known for its militarist attitude and emphasis on only accepting the New Testament as legitimate. Features:\n§Y*§! May declare Holy War or Crusade on anyone of a different religion, even other Christians\n§Y*§! May gain the Icon-Breaker trait after sieging a Christian temple\n§Y*§! May expend Piety to raise units of zealots during a war\n§Y*§! Paulicians only recognize the three Petrine Sees\n§Y*§! Paulicians may choose between the Alexandrite and Antiochian schools of theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
qarmatian;Qarmati;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
qarmatian_DESC;The Qarmatians are a extreme splinter sect of Isma'ili Islam, and believe that there are seven ages of man, each with a new religion and prophet, and the final age is approaching. They believe that the rest of the Isma'ilis have lost the faith, and that Muhammad son of Isma'il is still in hiding, waiting to return as the Mahdi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tondrakian;Tondrakian;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tondrakian_DESC;Tondrakians are an anti-feudal, anti-church sect that originally flourished in Armenia between the 9th and 11th Century. They denied the immortality of the soul, the afterlife, and the rights of the church to rule over its fellow man. They supported property rights for peasants and equality between men and women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
waqifi;Waqifite;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
waqifi_DESC;The Waqifi believe that the Imamate has ended before the main branch of Shi'ism has accepted it. To the Waqifi, the final Imam is the Mahdi who will return at the end of days, and they wait faithfully for him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zaydi;Zaydi;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zaydi_DESC;The Zaydis are a Shi'a group that believe that the 'Alid Imams are not infallible, but are divinely inspired and have a responsibility to lead rebellion against corrupt authority. Nor is the Imamate hereditary. Any 'Alid who rises up in rebellion can become an Imam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zurvanist;Zurvanist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zurvanist_DESC;Zurvanism is a branch of Zoroastrianism that believes in the existence of Zurvan, a genderless god of of infinite time (and space), for whom there is no distinction between good and evil. Zurvan is the parent of the two opposites representing the good god, Ahura Mazda, and the evil Angra Mainyu, unlike normal Zoroastrianism, where Ahura Mazda is the Supreme Being. Zurvanism is further divided by its three schools of thought: Aesthetic, Fatalistic and Materialistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### LAWS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
frat_priesthood;Fraticelli Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frat_priesthood_desc;While all priests are initially monastic in nature, just as within the Catholic Church, the Fraticelli belief is that it is imperative for priests to take a more active role in the spreading of the faith and the operation of government.

appoint_messalian_patriarch;Appoint Messalian Patriarch;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
appoint_messalian_patriarch_desc;The Bishopric of Antioch is considered to be the highest title within the Messalian hierarchy, and the bishop who holds it can be effectively annointed as the head of the entire Messalian faith -- provided he or she has the backing of a sufficiently powerful Messalian ruler, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_paulician_patriarch;Become Paulician Patriarch;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_paulician_patriarch_desc;Only one who possesses sufficient prestige and piety can declare themselves leader of all Paulician faithful, and that one will lead them against the rest of the heathens in this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
byz_suppress_paulicians;Suppress the Paulicians;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
byz_suppress_paulicians_desc;The Paulicians are becoming too much of a problem in the Empire. It is time to deal with them once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cathar_adoption;Adopt an Heir;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cathar_adoption_desc;For many of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, heirs cannot be acquired in the normal fashion. Thus it is quite acceptable for a ruler to adopt an orphaned [Root.Religion.GetName] child and raise it as their ownan act of generosity, if you will, towards someone who in any other circumstance would have few chances at a meaningful life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cathar_consolamentum;Consolamentum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cathar_consolamentum_desc;The only sacrament of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, the Consolamentum represented a purification of the faithful from sins gained throughout their life. Once the ritual baptism had occurred, the faithful [Root.Religion.GetName] would be considered 'Perfect' and be expected to live a life of celibacy -- as well as to spread the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith further. Most did not receive Consolamentum until their deathbeds, but the zealous would take the sacrament much earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
create_cathar_papacy;Create the Cathar Patriarch;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
create_cathar_papacy_desc;A truly great ruler, dedicated to the cause of the Cathars and a true Perfectus, might be able to raise up a member of the faithful as a Cathar Patriarch: a leader for the faithful everywhere, and able to direct his or her religion to spread throughout the known world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lollard_revoke_temple_named;Revoke [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s Religious Titles;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lollard_revoke_temple;Revoke Religious Titles;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lollard_revoke_temple_desc;Revoke all temple holdings from §Y[Root.GetBestName]§! if [Root.GetSheHe] is not Lollard or has the Wicked Priest trait. If [Root.GetSheHe] is both Lollard and doesn't have the Wicked Priest trait, §Y[From.GetBestName]§! will get a strong claim to all titles of higher than Baron tier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lollard_translate_bible;Translate the Bible;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lollard_translate_bible_desc;One of the ways the Catholic Church maintains its dominance over the common man is by ensuring that almost nobody can read the Bible. Perhaps the time has come to take the scripture out of the hands of the few and put it into the hands of the masses by ordering a translation of the Bible into the vernacular. It would be an incredibly expensive proposition, and take years to complete, but it would be a terrible blow to Catholic authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_abandon_prayers;Abandon Prayers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_abandon_prayers_desc;The process of driving out one's demons is an exhausting process, perhaps even dangerous. While it would mean failure in the eyes of the Holy Spirit, perhaps it is best to put aside the prayers for a time and restore your strength before attempting them again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_become_master;Achieve Perfection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_become_master_desc;To one of the Messalian faith, achieving perfection -- meaning one is free of the demons who bring with them mortal sin -- is the holiest state to which one can aspire. It means being one with God, and will make the Messalian a teacher of their fellow faithful. It also means that one is free of any obligations to mortal concepts of morality and constraint, as the idea of perfection is literal. If you are one with God, how can you possibly sin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_castrate;Castrate Yourself;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_castrate_desc;Follow in the path of the Saint Sabas Apokopos, one of the founders of the Messalian sect, and castrate yourself. In the eyes of the Messalian faith, it is one of the most holy acts a follower is capable of -- though naturally it can only be done once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_choose_patron_saint;Choose Patron Saint;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_choose_patron_saint_desc;The Messalians believe that there are four important patron saints that watch over them: Saint Nestor, Saint Adelphius, Saint Addai, and -- perhaps most shocking to other Christians -- Lucifer the Lightbringer. It is important that a Messalian choose one of these patron saints to watch over them, and it will be the patron to whom they direct their daily prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

messalian_expel_daemon_desc;The Messalians believe that sins are literal demons that exist within the body, and that the only way to rid oneself of sin is to endure ritual fasting and rigorous prayer until the demons are forced out.

EVTTITLE_emf_heresy_2011;The Council of [council_location.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2011;A Cathar heresy has been brewing for some time, begun by numerous ascetic priests who espouse strange beliefs regarding there being two Gods--a 'Good God' who created the spiritual realm, and an 'Evil God' who created the material realm and all of humanity, and the reason why all humans are filled with sin--but with the gathering of these priests at a council in the province of [From.GetName], the heresy has begun to spread like wildfire. At this council, the priests codified many of their laws and spread territories into 'bishoprics', and they have since gained many followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He speaks out against the greed and excess of Catholic priests, the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and the over-emphasis of reverence paid to Christian idols. Many peasants, having no love for the corrupt priests of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], have embraced his teachings and the Lollard heresy is spreading like wildfire throughout the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2017;Translation of the Bible;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2017;Several years ago, [Root.GetTitledName] ordered a translation of the Bible into the vernacular. The [Root.Religion.GetName]s believe, after all, that one of the way the Catholic Church maintains control over the masses is by restricting those who can read it to those educated few versed in the ancient tongue of Latin. A non-Latin Bible is, then, something of a revelation. Fortunately, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s Bible is considered to be a fine translation: clear, easy to read, and already quite popular with the common man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A non-Latin Bible is, then, something of a revelation. Unfortunately for [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [Root.GetHerHis] new Bible is not only considered something of a poor translation -- with far too many parts obviously swayed by the politics of the day -- it is mostly mocked outside of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and mostly disregarded. Even so, it is of great interest to many, and has aided the spread of the [Root.Religion.GetName]s faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_heresy_2018;We will keep working on it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2020;The death of [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] means that [From.GetHerHis] efforts to translate the Bible into the vernacular have been put on hold.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2025;A disgruntled Catholic monk by the name of Brother Angelo has heavily criticized [Root.GetTitledName], and in so doing has rocked the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. Brother Angelo denies that [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is legally the pope, as [Root.GetSheHe] has abrogated the Rule of St. Francis -- which, according to his doctrine, represented the pure and simple Gospel. He has asserted that all of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s decrees are thus invalid, and that all Catholics who follow the Pope's will have lost the grace of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2031;The founding of the Waldensian Church was mostly underground, and the so the early initiates organized themselves into cells.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2115;Up until now, Bogomilist priests have all used different letters and gospels in their preaching, a result of the scattered and disparate beginnings of the faith.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2120;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have been rewarded today after a prominent Perfecti in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] issued a proclamation of support.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2124;A recent revival of Bogomilist traditionalism has taken hold in [PrimaryTitle.GetName], with numerous preachers cropping up who actively deride your efforts to reform the faith as being exactly the same sort of tyrannical structure they rebelled against in the first place. Needless to say, this has not been helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2125;A prominent Perfecti in [demand_province.GetName] has publicly begged that you slow down, if not outright stop, the process of Bogomilist reform.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2127;A prominent Perfecti has recently taken issue with your desire to reform the Bogomilist faith, pointing out a number of flaws in your argument without ever actually saying outright that your intention is solely to grab power and force the faithful into compliance.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2128;[Root.GetTitledName]'s recent victory against [From.GetTitledName] in [Root.Location.GetName] has been hailed as a major victory for Bogomilism, and has spread the notion that perhaps the continuing reforms of the faith have God's favor after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2129;[Root.GetTitledName]'s recent staggering loss against [From.GetTitledName] in [Root.Location.GetName] has been hailed as a sign that the ongoing reforms of the Bogomilist faith do not have God's favor after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Bogomilists across the world are now more formally organized, though many still do not consider them a true religion, and they remain opposed to any kind of formal church that emulates the Orthodox priesthood. Even so, there are many that object to even these changes, saying that Bogomilism has betrayed its own roots at a powerful [Root.GetLordLady]'s behest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Preachers throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are questioning how far this will go, and whether the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] has not perhaps betrayed Bogomilism's principles for the sake of power. Whatever the case, Bogomilist priests are now unified under a common liturgy, a single sacred text, and operate out of temples -- far more than the disparate heretics from where they sprang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
