		Adventurer update
			Claimant adventurers must now raise sufficient coin for their cause in order to actually begin the war. They will assume their temporary title immediately, and begin touring realms outside their target's in search of rulers who will either grant them coin or let them canvass their demesne and vassals for support. Those rulers also have the option of sending them away or even attempting to capture the adventurer in order to ransom them back to the adventurer's target. Once the adventurer gets enough coin, they will raise their army and attack -- based from the capital of a ruler who offered them assistance. If they don't raise enough, are imprisoned, or end up with a title, then their adventure will be abandoned.
			Women may now also become claimant adventurers if the target title does not have Agnatic succession and the claimant has the Ambitious trait.
			Duchy adventurers (such as vikings in search of their own duchies) have had their targeting AI upgraded, and will tend to target smaller realms of a different culture group before they target larger ones. Seafaring adventurers will also focus on targets which are in the same 'sea zone' (example: Norwary, Denmark, Britain and the northern coast of France and Germany are all part of the same *North Sea zone*) rather than ranging further.
			The first 100 years of the Viking Age will now see Norse duchy adventurers being far more commonplace.
