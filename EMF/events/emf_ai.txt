####   AGNATIC-COGNATIC RETREAT   ####
######################################

# The Problem:

# It is very easy for players to expand very quickly via marriage if the AI is dumb enough (and it is) to
# switch their gender succession laws to Agnatic-Cognatic from Agnatic when they only have a female heir of
# their progeny (but may have a male brother or uncle that would still keep the title within their family if
# the law were Agnatic) _without any regard whatsoever to whether that particular female heir is married to a
# player / player son / etc. To make Agnatic-Cognatic on foreign titles less easy to abuse by players and to
# improve the performance of the AI, we should teach it when Agnatic-Cognatic is a bad idea and help it revert
# to Agnatic (or block passing Agnatic-Cognatic) if necessary.

# NOTE: We still want the AI to be able to use Agnatic-Cognatic to avoid dynastic extinction (and for a small
# amount of titles, it is the default for historical reasons).

# The Solution:

# Whenever a player arranges a marriage successfully (on_marriage) with somebody of their dynastic progeny
# (plus themselves) and a daughter of a feudal/imperial holder of a de jure title of at least DUKE tier (her
# place in the line of succession currently doesn't matter -- players will plot-assassinate right through all
# of that most likely), then we do one of two things:

# 1. If the title is Agnatic, then we set a flag on the AI ruler blocking passing of Agnatic-Cognatic. On
# death of such a ruler with such a flag, we evaluate whether it's necessary to inherit it (if player / player
# progeny is still married to a daughter of the new ruler).

# 2. If the title is Agnatic-Cognatic, we wait randomly anywhere from half a year to five years to set the
# gender succession law to Agnatic & set the same law-blocking flag as in (1).

# In Sum: For players and their dynastic progeny, they will need to scoop up kingdoms on a longer time horizon
# -- more or less the "Salic Law Only" way (wait for princess to inherit a pressed claim upon death of ruler,
# wait for princess to die so that her pressed claims will be inherited by their player-dynastic-progeny kids
# as weak unpressed claims, and then press those claims). For player-dynastic non-progeny, they can still
# abuse Agnatic-Cognatic (but the incentive to do so is less, of course, because it doesn't allow rapid
# centralization of, e.g., several kingdom titles in a few generations into the player demesne). However,
# there are still ways in which traditional Agnatic-Cognatic pseudo-abuse can occur: they just aren't all that
# likely to happen, hence "pseudo-abuse."

#### FREE INVESTITURE WORKAROUND ####
#####################################

# The Problem:

# AI rulers, under [at least] elective types of succession such as Elective Monarchy and Princely Elective,
# will go nuts nominating their eligible heir progeny to be bishops if Free Investiture is in force. They'll
# happily go to the extreme of making all of their male progeny bishops -- and not even attempting to retain
# one son that would be eligible to inherit their titles, resulting in the early and stupid death of their
# dynasty's reign over their title(s) as well as the end of their bloodline. The AI will often even nominate
# these sons to *several* bishroprics, just to ensure that their young son makes it into the priesthood ASAP
# (since they will become a priest the moment any one of the currently presiding bishops dies or abdicates).

# Restrictions:

# 1. There is no on_action for being nominated a bishop.

# 2. There is no way to "un-nominate" a bishop besides landing him as feudal before he can become a priest.

# Scope & Requirements:

# 0. Only concerned with DUKE+ rulers with Princely Elective succession on their primary title. We may need to
# expand the scope to include other succession laws like Elective Monarchy, Elective Gavelkind, or even
# Primogeniture, but I've not recently seen the AI do totally preposterous shit with these other succession
# laws and Free Investiture. I've also not been experimenting with them to find out either, so...

# 1. We may land multiple sons, although to keep things simple, we're only trying for one.

# 2. We may land them as early in their life as we want.

# 3. We might try landing a second son if it suits the situation (i.e., laws and available titles) better.

# 4. If the ruler has Gavelkind / Elective Gavelkind duchies, we want to minimize our impact upon the total
# succession by doing this landing of son(s); we don't want to actually mess up the succession in the process.

# 5. If the ruler already has landed feudal sons that can inherit their primary title, we don't do shit.

# NOTE: My usage of the term "sons" is generic -- I'm referring to the gender preferred by the ruler's gender
# succession law.


# The Solution:

# For these types of rulers and laws, we aggressively try to land at least one son that could theoretically
# inherit the ruler's primary title well before they even reach adulthood and can be nominated as a bishop.

# Remember that the primary title, at least in the most high-profile cases, probably doesn't have the same
# succession law as the ruler's dynastic holdings (e.g., a Kaiser under Princely Elective probably has a
# couple Gavelkind duchies under his HRE title). Because of how landing your eldest / senior heir in the wrong
# way (e.g., too many titles, too high of tier of title, or in the wrong de jure location) under split
# inheritance laws such as Gavelkind and Elective Gavelkind can royally screw things up, we need to be extra
# careful.

# Our first priority is to try and land the player_heir if he is of the ruler's progeny or else simply the
# eldest son. If *any* lower-tier titles are Gavelkind or Elective Gavelkind and there are no other sons
# eligible to inherit, then we are restricted to landing the eldest/senior heir as a baron in the ruler's
# capital county. If there is another son eligible to inherit with these Gavelkind duchies, then land him
# basically anywhere else (though we must stay within the de jure borders of our primary title). If [Elective]
# Gavelkind is not in play, then any son can be landed anywhere without inheritance consequences, and we'll
# prefer to land the player_heir/eldest.

# Most of the logic shall be in [ ... WIP ... ]
