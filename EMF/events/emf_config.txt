#				 been set for us by now. If running on the vanilla map, no such global flag is set.

		# erasure behavior is to auto-build a single tribal holding in the nomadic province upon transfer of its
		# county title via some means (just wars of conquest, for the most part).

		# history files' *intentional* province culture and religion at any given start date when doing first-time
		# campaign setup.
		#
		# Before antinomad runs, when a nomadic province's culture or religion differs from what is specified in
		# province history, it's because the provinces are owned by nomads.
		#
		# In these cases, vanilla CK2's "immediate local culture/religion override" property for empty/nomadic
		# provinces has screwed us, so antinomad then corrects all these cases in a similar way to the LATB mechanic
		# (Leave A Tribe Behind -- see description re: enabling/disabling it in emf_config.1): it either builds a
		# tribal holding or a temple holding (the latter if the province would've had a temple in it at that start
		# date were Horse Lords disabled, else the former) to make the province no longer empty, and it then corrects
		# culture/religion (the culture/religion change will only work if the province is non-empty).
