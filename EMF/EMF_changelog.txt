EMF 3.03 [BETA]
	[Ambitions] Blocked the Find Hobby ambition if using Way of Life DLC, as it isn't compatible with the Way of Life method for assigning lifestyle traits
	Vassal AIs must be king-tier or higher to fabricate claims outside their realm; however, vassal duke AIs may do so as well if the target realm's top liege is a player
	AI rulers won't use de jure county claims, de jure duchy claims, or third-party de jure county claims to conquer AI merchant republics' capitals unless they are themselves another merchant republic and not part of the same greater realm
	Distribute Recently Acquired Titles:
		Now also works for counties acquired through inheritance
		Cosmetic improvements (some automatically-generated tooltips were misleading, and a [wrong] character portrait was shown in the main province-prompt event under certain conditions)
		Once decision is taken, it will now prompt for the full set of recently-acquired counties and no longer stop once your character is no longer over their demesne limit (simply don't grant what you don't want to grant)
	FIX: Religious Reconquest now, like standard Holy War, allows Reformed Norse to wage war over sea zones
	FIX: Bulgarian Empire title creation conditions now consistent with other empire titles (minimum realm size of 120)
	OPTIMIZED: Dynamic levy efficiency laws are now only applied to a ruler's primary title rather than all primary-tier titles and should automatically copy whenever their primary title changes (plus other optimizations)


EMF 3.02 [2014-12-23]
	Seduction:
		Optimization of the seduction focus's CPU overhead (reduced the amount of conditions that need to be constantly evaluated by any given AI considering other AIs for seduction)
		If the target is chaste, you cannot seduce them if they're married or already have a lover
		AI will not seduce zealous, non-pagan married women-- thanks to cybrxkhan's STOP (Stop The Orgy, Please!) mini-mod for this idea in particular (the rest of STOP's rules are now covered by EMF too, though with some differences)
		AI is now interested in targets that have the *cough* 'Well-Endowed' (fertile) trait from VIET (worth half as much as Attractive targets); if target has both traits, the weighting stacks additively
		AI won't pick the seduction _focus_ if craven
		If AI already has at least one lover, it must be lustful to pick the seduction _focus_
		If AI has at least 3 lovers, it will never pick the seduction _focus_ (and cancel it once cancellation is allowed, if already picked)
		AI base rate of seduction reduced by approx. 3-fold
		Unless AI is lustful, they will not seduce anyone if they already have a lover
		AI will never seduce if they become infirm after focus selection
		AI will not seduce targets that are celibate, eunuchs, or infirm
		AI will not seduce if the target has a negative VIET congenital trait that makes them unattractive (e.g., wrymouth); vanilla already does this for its relevant negative congenital traits
		AI will be 1/3 as interested in seducing any given target for each additional lover that they already have (multiplicative stacking)
	Focus can be changed once every 4 years rather than 5 now
	Various minor defines tweaks
	FIX: Rebel leaders should now be able to raise levies of fellow revolters
	MINOR: Decision 'Found a Merchant Republic' now converts the capital _holding_ of the tribe to a city rather than converting the capital _province_ to a republic (should be equivalent, but map issues can affect this)


EMF 3.01 [2014-12-19]
	New 'Bless With Luck' and 'Remove Luck' diplo-actions for Lucky Ruler assignment now take into account whether you're at war with the target character
	Province religious conversion via councillors is now significantly less rapid
	Special province religious conversion rules for Rum, coastal Turks, and inland Turks made specific to the Anatolian / Byzantine / Rumite geopolitical situation rather than applying everywhere
	Dynamic levy efficiency (dynlevy):
		For players, efficiency changes are now instantaneously reflected by changes in realm_size (updates while still paused; no longer need to wait 1 game day to see changes)
		For AI, dynamic levy efficiency law recalculations are now no longer triggered within a day of any title transfer and instead more efficiently recalculated in batch on a periodic pulse
	EMF now uses vanilla merchant republics
		Gotland, the Hansa, and Amalfi return. The other custom republics, with the exception of those in the Indian Ocean, were largely no longer functional after patch 2.2 (Charlemagne) in any case.
		Rather than add more custom merchant republics statically, a scenario customization decision is being considered to enable dynamic merchant republic creation/conversion in-game wherever desired (coastal only).
		Nevertheless, more custom merchant republics may still be added yet.
	Succession laws:
		Forced the HRE to stick with feudal elective succession for AI emperors (though succession law factions can still form and force a change)
		Opinion modifiers further tweaked for the available feudal succession types to improve balance and worthwhile strategic diversity. Notable changes:
			Regular gavelkind is now the most attractive from a vassal- and dynasty-opinion standpoint (and its +30% demesne bonus).
			Primogeniture is not without its sacrifices.
			Seniority is now significantly more viable than previously. Consider trying this some time if you haven't, especially if you're breaking out of a tribal or gavelkind situation with many disparate titles held by separate dynasty members.
			Feudal elective no longer awards vassal opinion, as this is frankly a nonsensical CK2 tradition. If de jure elector vassals were an opinion class that could be targeted by law, then it could make sense to award [i]only them[/i] opinion. However, this is not possible, and even so, the case for any bonus is still weak for a feudal elective title, a title whose consitituent de jure electoral titles' consensus upon succession is fundamentally more legitimate than all hereditary claim to it. [If anything, elective lieges ought to think slightly higher of their de jure elector vassals (the reverse).]
				Expect more changes regarding feudal elective in the future to reduce its potential for abuse and more appropriately model the legal/philosophical implications of such a law.
		Removed some vestigial references to the believed-no-longer-necessary 'Decentralized HRE' law in succession law requirements


EMF 3.0 [2014-12-18]
	Compatible with CKII v2.3 (Way of Life); not backwards-compatible with older versions of CKII
	Title-specic malus in the form of the 'Decentralized HRE' law experimentally removed; it should no longer be necessary due to more general balancing mechanic improvements in this version
	AI Lucky Rulers:
		Now unencumbered by any trait restrictions in all CBs, just like players
		Bless With Luck: One can now assign Lucky Ruler status to a specific ruler via this new diplomacy action (regardless of whether the Lucky Rulers scenario customization decision was taken, so luck can now be precisely assigned)
		Remove Luck: Having second thoughts? You can always remove Lucky Ruler status at will with this new diplomacy action.
	Muslim County Conquest: AI restrictions for usage when an inter-religion war greatly lessened (player usage unaffected)
	Warrior/Fighter traits now factor into WoL personal duel system and their bonuses were tweaked a bit
	Defines (variables which factor into various base game formulae) changes:
		Holding levy sizes now half as influenced by the martial stat of the particular holding owner (HOLDING_LEVY_SIZE_OWNER_MARTIAL_MULT = 0.75, HOLDING_LEVY_SIZE_OWNER_MARTIAL_BASE = 0.025)
		Nobles are more likely to choose to personally command their soldiers when a liege raises their levies (OPINION_WHEN_MARSHAL_INSTEAD_OF_SELF = 0)
		Vassals will no longer provide any liege levies at all when their liege opinion is below -50 (MIN_LEVY_RAISE_OPINION_THRESHOLD = -50)
		Vassals will provide a minimum of 25% of their liege levy obligation at the new -50 liege opinion threshold for levies (with linear scaling above the threshold). E.g., -100 to -49 opinion nets 0% levies, -50 opinion nets 25% levies, 0 opinion nets 50% levies, 25 opinion nets 62.5% levies, 50 opinion nets 75% levies, and so on (MIN_LEVIES_ABOVE_OPINION_THRESHOLD = 0.25)
		When unloading troops (e.g., raiders) from a galley, it now takes twice as long as previously, so it's now the same as vanilla (ARMY_UNLOAD_MOVE_COST = 20.0)
		When loading troops (e.g., raiders) back into galleys (when the ships are not in port), it now takes twice as long as it did for them to unload (ARMY_LOAD_MOVE_COST = 40.0)
		Capturing the heir of your enemy during a war is now "only" worth 30% warscore instead of 50% (CAPTURED_HEIR_WAR_SCORE = 30.0)
		While levy reinforce rates are the same (4%/yr base), vassals' reinforcement of their liege levy contribution reinforces 25% more slowly than their personal levy (LIEGE_LEVY_REINF_RATE = 0.03)
		Vassals pay 20% less for levy maintenance when the levies are raised by a liege rather than the vassal personally (LIEGE_LEVY_COST_MULTIPLIER = 0.8)
		Viceroys (including minor/duke viceroys) provide 20% less liege levies, ceteris paribus-- now the same as vanilla (LIEGE_LEVY_VICE_ROYALTY_MULTIPLIER = 0.8)
		During civil wars, the revolt leader will be able to raise more troops than normal from his fellow revolters (REBEL_LEADER_MINIMUM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1.25)
		More severe penalties to liege levy contributions depending upon how far they are away from the liege's capital. Strict distance is not used for these penalties; instead, "concentric rings" of decreasingly-concentrated de jure territory tiers with respect to the liege's capital county are used. EMF was (and still is) much less severe in these penalties than vanilla because of its additional 'dynamic levies' (or, 'dynlevy') mechanic which also scales down effective liege levies with realm size. However, some adjustments were in order to better achieve EMF's goals:
			CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1 (was 1.15)
			CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.8 (was 0.9)
			CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.5 (was 0.8)
			OUTSIDE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.5 (was 0.7, now no extra penalty for your capital being in an area of the map with no de jure empire-- also just a lot less arbitrary)
		Weakened medium-to-large lieges' levy potential when spreading development over their entire capital duchy rather than concentrating on their capital county; there are still major levy bonuses for capital county, now neither bonus nor penalty for capital duchy, and appropriately-varying penalties elsewhere (CAPITAL_DUCHY_LEVY_MULT = 1-- was 1.25, CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1-- was 1.15)
		Some strategic notes:
			One still has every incentive to completely control their capital duchy (i.e., all province capitals) in order to maximize tax income due to more vassal barons. If your capital county has a lot of capacity and your demesne limit is scarce, the trade-off between maximum taxes (spread yourself over duchy) and levies (pump capital full of castles) is your choice to make. Also consider that retinues are very expensive but have obvious military advantages over levies.
			Keep in mind that the aforementioned, dramatic capital county levy bonuses (as well as the de jure tier liege levy penalties) apply to EVERY ruler-- not just you; therefore, it is extremely beneficial to total realm levy power to maximize the demesne efficiency of all your vassals by ideally limiting every ruler in your realm to a single county (regardless of tier).
			Viking raiding parties now face more serious risks, as they cannot instantly escape the moment you send an army their way. When raiding as a Viking, you're going to need to use more realistic tactics and target selection to plunder and pillage with the best.
			Capital selection matters a lot. Don't be afraid to move your capital. Unless you happen to start with an ideal capital, you should probably move your court at least once. In some areas of the map or upon major conquests/inheritances, it may be beneficial to do so a number of times. Remember, the de jure setup around the capital is critical-- not just the province and encompassing duchy.
			Be more wary of overextending your realm territorially. Upon reaching monumental sizes, something to consider would be spinning-off independent kingdoms that will aid you more efficiently in war.
	FIX: Automatic empire disintegration should no longer create titular kingdoms when searching for a valid king-level title for the emperor upon which to fallback
	FIX: Pagan holy war now costs only 200 piety the first time and then 300 piety thereafter (was costing 500 piety instead)
	FIX: You may now properly press third-party (for a vassal) de jure claims on counties and baronies against different-religion holy orders
	FIX: Peace pledge ambition is now properly enforced by third-party claim CBs (cannot even attempt to press de jure claims or regular claims for a subject character while peace pledge is active)
	MINOR: AI now actually always prefers to 'Press All Claims' rather than press them individually
	MINOR: Eliminated needless exceptions for Byzantium & Roman Empire from all 5 de jure claim CBs' tooltips


EMF 2.06 [2014-12-07]
	Cleaned-up tooltips for 'Adopt Feudalism,' 'Found a Merchant Republic,' and all laws which are unlocked by technology (visual improvement, less redundant)
	Magyar starting troops/commanders boosted so that they can actually win their 867 invasion of Pannonia/Hungary (has been impossible since patch 2.2)
	If startinIg at a bookmark in which Hagia Sophia is controlled by a Catholic, it will be automatically granted to the Ecumenical Patriarch to avoid early mending of the Catholic Schism
	EMF 2.05's hack to improve AI raid targeting by enabling prepared invasions for all pagans has been reverted (caused more issues than it addressed)


EMF 2.05 [NO OFFICIAL RELEASE]
	Maintenance event which kills useless, auto-spawned courtiers (no claims, no skills, etc.) moved from yearly pulse to 5-yearly pulse
		Cuts down on the dead character count as the campaign progresses, because they quickly respawn (optimization)
	Succession law opinion modifiers and requirements reworked to provide more strategy and clarity while also being more robust
	Raiding:
		Looting is again allowed for the reformed version of pagan religions. If players want to do it, so be it.
		Due to a bug in CKII 2.1.1 regarding AI raid targeting, all pagan religions capable of raiding have prepared invasions temporarily enabled. If non-Norse, don't expect it to work, but it's necessary to make the AI properly raid at this time. Additionally, note that this will cause coastal, non-Norse pagans to also raid via boat from time to time, although they won't be able to navigate rivers. Please refrain from reporting this as a bug; it is a hack to fix raiding for the AI in Charlemagne that will hopefully be removed soon.
	AI Lucky Rulers:
		Now much more likely to join and create independence factions
		Now able to use the 'Bid For Independence CB' against AI lieges even when a de jure vassal and regardless of their traits
		Can fabricate minor claims (via chancellor-- not plots) a bit faster
	Automatic Empire Disintegration:
		FIX: 2.04's change which prevented automatic disintegration for the first 30 years of any campaign should now work properly
		As a special case, the HRE now requires a 150 realm_size minimum after the year 1100 (rather than 100 realm_size)
	AI 'Conqueror' trait now has a pretty icon
	Independence faction now just a bit more rowdy in the face of a competing claimant faction (or the possibility of one)
	Decadence revolts can now kick in at 60% decadence, are much more likely to happen at higher levels, and are more dangerous
	Norse conversion to Catholicism now much more likely after 930, also reversed a related major vanilla bug with Norse conversion likelihood
	FIX: Haruriyyah holy order now comes with enough galleys to transport itself (vanilla bug)


EMF 2.04 [2014-11-19]
	Full CKII v2.2.1 compatibility
	Reformed pagan religions can no longer raid unless tribal
		Otherwise, raiding's just plain overpowered and against the spirit of reformation, especially with same-religion raiding in CM.
		Note that Reformed Norse can still jet through major river systems as they please.
	Automatic Empire Disintegration:
		Rump / broken empires are now exempt from automatic disintegration for the first 30 years of any campaign.
		Bulgarian Empire will now have a chance to survive and thrive.
		Mongol Empire (see the dedicated bookmark-- not the usual Mongols) will now have time to establish itself.
		For Latin Empire starts, Byzantium will have three long decades to reclaim Constantinople before losing empire-tier status.
	A new 'Conqueror' trait is now automatically applied to AI horde invaders to ensure that plunder and rampage fills their hearts
		Only affects AI disposition (no trait bonuses).
		Automatically removed when they convert to a less aggressive religion (except for the Timurids) or become incapable.
		Fear the Mongols / Timurids / Aztecs! Fear!
	AI Lucky Rulers now more aggressively pursue what they want as well as independence if vassal to another lord (no new bonuses)
	Cutting down on needless vanilla popups by converting them to notification events which appear in high-priority messages tab instead
		Job: Marshal: Levy reinforcements letter event converted (and duration of modifier doubled to two years)
		Job: Lord Spiritual: Indirect province religious conversion (done by a vassal's lord spiritual) letter event converted
	Muslim County Conquest, when a holy a war, now properly allows neighbors of the same religion of the defender to join the war
	Default Obligations/Focus demesne laws can/will now always be passed if no other laws in their slider group are set
		Prevents "locked law" issues which can occur when, e.g., usurping a higher-tier Muslim title as a non-Muslim or vice versa
	The effects of province conversion on religious authority have been dramatically decreased
		The prior religion (the one which was converted) no longer receives a negative RA hit upon conversion.
		The new religion (the one to which the province converted) only receives 1% RA for 5 years rather than 20 years.
		Hopefully, this better balances religious authority in the 1066 start while still reflecting an authority boost from conversion


EMF 2.03
	Full CKII v2.2.0.4 beta branch support and compatch
		No longer works without opting into the CKII beta branch on Steam (2.2's initial release was broken)
	Unreformed pagans may now adopt feudalism or republicanism (tribal opinion malus still applies, though)
	De jure empires now require a minimum realm_size (number of holdings in realm) of 120 to create
	Custom empires still require 180 realm_size, but if you you hold 3+ kingdom titles, then only 120 realm_size is required
	Technology tooltips for unlocking decisions/laws now properly shown (underlying issue fixed in recent beta patch)
	Added Lombard and Visigothic cultural combat tactics
	(Vanilla Map) Major adjustment to de jure structure of Byzantium with new campaigns
	VANILLA FIX: Closed loopholes on merchant republic Doges passing seniority succession on their primary title
	(EMF+SWMH) FIX: A few recent defines.lua changes were out of sync with the main version
	FIX: Holy war was costing more piety than advertised


EMF 2.02
	VANILLA FIX: Workaround for all laws/decisions enabled by technology not being usable regardless of tech level
		'Adopt Republicanism' requires Trade Practices level 1
		'Adopt Feudalism' requires Noble Customs level 1
		'King Viceroys' requires Legalism level 4
		'Duke Viceroys' requires Legalism level 8 (unless playing the ERE or 'Imperial Administration' has been enacted)
		Centralization slider levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 require Legalism levels 1, 2, 3, and 5, respectively
		'Imperial Administration' requires Majesty level 5


EMF 2.01
	First feature-complete release for Charlemagne
	CKII v2.2 (Charlemagne) Compatibility Patch Continued:
		Full CKII v2.2.0.2 beta branch support and compatch
		Full CKII v2.2.0.1 beta branch support and compatch
		FIX: Minor province settlement graphics issue
		FIX: Syntax error in a presently unused trait definition
		FIX: INTER_MUSLIM_WAR_MONTHLY_PIETY_COST = 1 (was accidentally doubled in compatch)
	(Vanilla Map) Adopted fresh landed_titles (de jure structure and title definitions) from vanilla (with modifications)
	Imperial Administration can now be unlocked with near-maximum crown authority (but the ERE gets it for free)
	When forming a new empire, King's Peace laws are automatically translated into Emperor's Peace
	Children will now have a chance to express some 'nature' (vs. 'nurture') personality traits automatically at a young age.
		The trait selection is strongly influenced by both the traits of the father and the mother-- not by the guardian.
		Mom's personality traits actually matter to your kids' future now, so marry wisely.
		Should see fewer annoying vanilla ward events and a more plausible personality development process rather than the usual vanilla breeding program.
	Ibadi holy order rebalanced to fit EMF's holy order maintenance/size standards.
		They get galleys enough to transport themselves and are composed of archers, light cavalry, and camel cavalry.
		Their maintenance-normalized size is double that of either of the 2 Sunni or Shiite holy orders, because there is no second Ibadi holy order.
		The Haruriyyah also now simply require that Muslim jihads have been unlocked to form.
	Combat tactics and special_troops upgrade
		Camel cavalry should now be a lot more effective in combat than previously.
		FIX: Vanilla's special_troops (elephants, camel_cavalry, and horse_archers) maintenance and skirmish/melee/pursuit attack/defense values reverted to intentional, pre-2.2 values. 
	Province religion conversion now affects religious authority (+1% per province converted, -1% per province led astray-- heresy appearance doesn't count)
	Provinces of different culture, culture_group, religion, or religion_group now cause small local_revolt_risk in addition to their numerous other maluses
	Councillors again lift Fog of War when assigned; multiplayer exploit no longer an issue due to the inability to instantly reassign councillors (now requires min. 14 days)
	Sieges take 20% less time to complete, ceteris paribus.
	Battles against religious enemies yield less piety (-33%).
	Laws:
		Slightly more forgiving vassal opinion modifiers for all Obligations slider increments (+2 opinion)
		Fresh succession law implementation, simpler approach than PB to requirements for passing these laws
		FIX: For a Decentralized HRE or an ERE which hasn't even partially reformed its Themes System, Obligations law sliders cannot be raised
		FIX: Patricians now always have access to the Obligations/Focus sliders.
	MAJOR: Countless other undocumented, though *usually* relatively small, changes.


EMF 2.0
	Updated to CKII 2.2 and added support for all of the Charlemagne (CM) DLC content
	[Decadence] As promised, with the advent of CM, decadence has returned! Woe!
	[Decadence] Drunkard trait no longer treated as if it were charitable or diligent trait (vanilla bugs)
	In approval of 2.2's changes, EMF and vanilla now have an identical retinue model
		Cost is a bit higher than previously, although it's very close in nature to the prior EMF model
	AI prisoners will essentially never request better accomodations if you're at war
	Spymaster 'Study Technology' job action now fires less frequently and doesn't scale as well with spymaster intrigue skill
	Crusades now unlock if either the province owner OR his top liege aren't Christian for Braunschweig, Cologne, Paris, Toulouse, and Provence
	Rulers less likely to declare independence from their religious head if the religion has at least 40% authority
	Research points 'ahead penalty' raised to 40% per level beyond ideal year (previously 30%)
	Children are now only inherently liked by +10 opinion (except when they're a liege) rather than +15 opinion
	While doing a sweep for consistency and completeness for the 2.2 patch:
		The Anti-King Faction should now be prioritized in realms where an antipope is installed
		'Coastal County Republic' CB is now open to Muslims if the defender is also a Muslim
		'Coastal County Republic' CB may now only be used upon provinces that are adjacent or up to 2 sea zones away from the attacker
		'Duchy Adventure' CB toned-down a bit (minor)
		Can no longer ask to join a war being waged with the 'Pagan County Conquest' CB
		When subjugating rulers directly, the 'Tribal Invasion' CB now appropriately applies 'Subjugated' or 'Subjugated by Same Religion' opinion modifiers
		AI behavioral guidelines added to many CBs to improve AI war declaration plausibility
		FIX: Though it should have been released with Rajas of India, one may now wage war with the 'Buddhist Holy War' CB
		FIX: Pressing another's claim now always earns the correct opinion modifier (not de jure claims, which were fine-- personal claims)
		FIX: Claimant faction wars or otherwise pressing a third party's claim on your liege now properly respects the cooldown on [forced] loss of Crown Authority
		FIX: Merchant Republic AIs should now use their CBs more effectively
		FIX: Duke- or higher-tier vassals can choose independence after a successful tribal invasion (yep, decadence invasions are back for now)
		FIX: A number of achievements that were previously not fulfilled when their conditions were met are now properly fulfilled [NOTE: We still don't encourage Ironman]
	Due to a bug that breaks triggered modifiers in patch 2.2:
		The ERE's 'Disorganized' triggered modifier that lasts from 1066-1081 no longer exists (non-critical malus to army morale and morale recovery rate)
		Decentralized HRE and Themes System laws have been refactored as demesne laws rather than crown laws (superior approach, so net win)
	FIX: Weather module would sometimes fail to apply or regionally spread a province modifier for Heavy Rains


EMF 1.03 [final version for CKII 2.1.6]
	(EMF+SWMH) Empire disintegration, for empires not dependent upon Constantinople, kicks in at the same realm size minimum as for the vanilla map (100 holdings)
	FIX: Temporary revolt title dynamic levy laws now properly adjusted for faction size upon third-party claimant faction war declaration and immediately cleaned-up after the war (like all other types of faction revolts)
	FIX: 'De Jure County Claim' CBs for counties already covered by a valid 'De Jure Duchy Claim' CB are no longer listed, as previously intended (minor)
	FIX: Clarified requirements for attacking holy orders w/ SoA enabled for the ERE in third-party de jure claim CBs (minor)
	FIX: Third-party CBs (e.g., pressing someone else's claim) should now properly fulfill the 'Win a War' ambition


EMF 1.02
	Culture technology has been partially reset to vanilla: Noble Customs, Popular Customs, and Religious Customs again grant 2 opinion points per level rather than 1
	Military tweaks:
		RETINUE_FROM_REALMSIZE = 4.0 (-33%, vast majority of retinue cap comes from developing your demesne holdings anyway, so this is minor)
		RETINUE_REINFORCE_RATE = 0.03 (25% slower to reinforce, and this now properly makes them slower to reinforce than levies while at peace)
		COMMAND_MODIFIER_MARTIAL_MULTIPLIER = 0.05 (-33%, return to vanilla, incredibly high martial will no longer stack so strongly with leadership command modifiers)
	Research points 'ahead penalty' raised to 30% per level beyond ideal year (previously only 20%)
	Looting (actually completing sieges while raiding) is now considerably less profitable (raiding itself remains the same):
		LOOT_TAX_MULTIPLIER = 1.0 (-50% base gold derived from tax income of holdings)
		LOOT_BUILDING_MULTIPLIER = 0.015 (-25% extra gold derived from total cost of all buildings in holding)
    New decision: Distribute Newly Acquired Lands. Automatically distribute recently-acquired land, until you're no longer above your demesne limit
		Provinces remain marked 'recently acquired'	for 0.5-1.5 months; it is intended to be used while paused after a war, but pausing is optional.
		All conquests and grants of provinces to you are included in the mechanic.
		It will never distribute counties from your capital duchy, even if recently-acquired.
		Aside from also giving new random counts (1 per province) any baronies that you may have also conquered inside their new county (so that they may, in turn, grant the baronies to the appropriate types of characters-- maximizing opinion bonuses due to grants for all), the process always stops once you're no longer above your demesne limit.
		For every province being considered for auto-distribution, you will be explicitly prompted regarding the province first so that you may easily keep any choice provinces.
		TIP: Manually grant recently-acquired land to dynasty members or favorite vassals before taking the decision to neatly get rid of the rest.
	New CB: 'De Jure Duchy Claim.' Like 'De Jure County Claim' and 'De Jure Barony Claim' but at the duchy level. Usage:
		You must hold the de jure empire or kingdom of the duchy.
		If you're a King and not an Emperor, then you must also have passed either the Internal or Full King's Peace in your primary title.
		The defender must have at least two counties within the duchy (otherwise, 'De Jure County Claim' can be used).
		If it's possible to use this CB instead of multiple 'De Jure County Claim' wars in the same duchy, those 'De Jure County Claim' CBs will no longer be listed.
		In the CB list, these will simply be listed as 'De Jure Claim on <TITLE>', just as it is with 'De Jure County Claim,' so pay attention to the titles involved.
	New mechanic: Automatic Empire Disintegration.
		Any empire that either drops below a certain realm size or, in the case of Byzantium and the Latin Empire, loses control of Constantinople will now automatically be forfeit.
		If the emperor lacks any other empire or kingdom titles at time of forfeiture, EMF will search for an appropriate, de jure kingdom title (one which has no holder and passes the "51% rule" for provinces controlled within the kingdom) and grant it to the emperor. This prevents the Emperor from losing all his duke vassals when the empire title is destroyed.
		For empires unrelated to Constantinople, the realm size threshold for empire disintegration is <150 holdings on the SWMH map and <100 holdings on the vanilla map.
	All children are now inherently more liked by all characters (+15 opinion)-- except for direct vassals, should they be a child ruler
		Ergo, it is now more difficult for players in foreign courts to gather enough plot power to murder entire dynasties without a hitch.
	De jure barony claim CBs now have a truce length of only 2 years (rather than 10)
		No longer will clean-up of a few stray baronies take decades.
	Vast majority of CBs have been modified so that the AI prefers player targets to AI targets, all else being equal.
		If the AI has already determined a player is a valid and worthwhile target (i.e., thinks it might win) and must choose between the player and another equally terrifying, qualifying AI upon which to declare war, it will choose to declare war on the player. This is a rare situation.
		In practice, this will only make things significantly more difficult in the upcoming, optional Hardcore Mode, but the AI could still prove more aggressive against you than previously. Feel the Fear.
	50% increase in intrigue-scaled plot discovery chance when using spymaster's 'Scheme' job action
	Disabled redundant plot discovery via event for 'Scheme' job action and associated assassinations / thugs / mobs killing spymaster
	Councillors no longer lift fog-of-war due to multiplayer exploitation
	Personality trait restrictions removed from player for Become King ambition
	All crown laws now no longer have trait restrictions (succession type, vassal opinions, prestige, and other factors still matter)
	Great Goddess Isis now has sharper teeth
	(Lucky Rulers) Lucky liege levy law bonuses nerfed to 3/5 prior, vassal_opinion nerfed to 3/5 prior
	(EMF+SWMH) The de jure King of Ireland title now destroyed upon scenario startup, making all the Irish minors peers (de jure title still exists)
	FIX: Ambition to lower decadence disabled until Charlemagne
	FIX: (Lucky Rulers) Lucky trait inheritance now works while co-installed with VIET Events
	FIX: Ambition Fulfilled / Fulfilled Marriage Wish / Generous Relative opinions granted by councillor/other ambitions (vanilla bug)


EMF 1.01
	FIX: Imperial Reconquest CB no longer has 'Select valid Casus Belli' issue
	Religious Reconquest CB can now be used on Rum (or anyone that holds Rum) at all
	Holy War, Religious Reconquest, and Special Holy War CBs can now be used on a recently-formed Rum or Crusader State
	Imperial Reconquest CB no longer requires waiting 15 years after Rum forms or after scenario start if Rum is already formed at the scenario start
	Disabled vanilla "trait-shedding" events, which randomly remove a personality trait if you have more than 5 personality traits
	FIX: Pagan religions now correctly require only 30% religious authority to reform instead of 50% (consistent with nerf to controlled holy site bonuses)
	Holy War CB no longer requires any crown authority
	Muslim County Conquest CB, when a religious war, no longer requires any crown authority
	FIX: Muslim County Conquest CB, when a religious war, no longer enforces hidden trait restrictions upon the player
	AI ignores PB's "can't attack allied" restriction against player targets in all claim CBs, to be fair and to add succession crisis / dynastic feud mechanics back into the game
	AI ignores PB's trait restrictions in all CBs when attacking players, to be fair and more risky for the player
	AI ignores PB's de jure holy war restrictions when attacking players, to be fair and more risky for the player
	Reformed Norse may now use the Holy War and Religious Reconquest CBs across sea zones before the year 1100
	(PB/EMF) Tribal Invasion CB for non-Horde cultures now uses the same once-per-lifetime cooldown as the Pagan Subjugation CB (usage of the former will prevent the latter)


EMF 1.0
	Dynamic levies: For all rulers, liege levy-raising efficiency scales down with increasing realm size, the number of holdings in the ruler's (sub-)realm, on a very finely-grained nonlinear curve.
		This curve effectively balances large, decentralized realms; it relatively boosts smaller, more centralized realms; and yet it still ensures reliable and reasonable returns upon army size from conquest at every level.
		Players will note that total army sizes for large, decentralized realms are much smaller than they'd normally expect.
		Since all troop counts have been taken down a notch and the difference between larger and smaller realms (or vassals and lieges) significantly reduced, the world is alive with a much more dynamic AI when it comes to war.
		Players can see their current levy efficiency by scrolling down to the bottom of the Laws screen, where they will find a Levy Efficiency law, its associated percentage, and its effects in a tooltip.
		More information on the curve itself (which differs slightly between SWMH and vanilla maps) and its properties will be made public at a later date.
		NOTE: Currently, there might be a _cosmetic_ bug wherein it appears more than one dynlevy (dynamic levy) law is applied at once. In truth, only one of them is active, and it'll be automatically fixed when you change realm_size tiers (5-6 holdings/tier, so frequently). We've only seen this once, and it may have already been solved, but should players run into it, we've provided a debug event to cleanup the Laws view:
			Open up the console and invoke: event emf_dynlevy.24
	When a liege raises his liege levy, only half of the troops in a given vassal's subrealm are raised (vanilla-- in PB, it's 100%)
	PB-style demesne law sliders (Focus and Obligations) have been rewritten to provide different, easier to analyze effects that better complement the new liege levy system and make far more combinations realistically valid strategic choices.
		All vassal classes (castle, city, temple) contribute equal liege levy percentage changes for each law.  Ergo, liege levy army composition is far more balanced than previously.
		A player with a larger realm will find far more benefit than previously in increasing vassal obligations or, potentially, focusing upon levies rather than taxes, due to the countervailing effects of dynamic levies.
	Weather system that considers terrain, season, and other factors is constantly running in the background, serving its meteorologic might upon clusters of provinces throughout the world. If a province is so included in a regional anomaly, it will experience major effects upon levy sizes, taxes, local army movement speed, and more.
		Look for snazzy new weather-related province modifier icons when selecting a province on the map.
		Though effects are short-lived (seasonal), beware modifiers affecting movement speed during tactical campaigns, and take advantage of enemy levy size weaknesses.
	Smart Tactics System. Combat tactics have been completely overhauled for more realistic combat tactics, outcomes, cultural command differences, and overall balance.
		Tactics as a whole have been standardized to prevent certain compositions from excelling beyond the norm. For example, English Massive Longbow Volley is now only as powerful as the other cultural tactics.
		Every culture has a cultural tactic now, instead of just a few. These cultural tactics are designed to match their unique retinue or cultural building, so that those compositions will excel.
		No longer will having a few stray units of a different type cause their tactic to pop up. Now having a large group of a single unit will completely force out irrelevant tactics.
		Taking a page from Better Army's and ClearCombat's books, every tactic has Good/Neutral/Bad variations. Even a Bad tactic is better than no tactic, but better commanders will use better tactics and be more effective overall.
		By bringing the bonuses from particular tactics in line with those from technology, terrain, cultural differences, and leadership, the player gets more of what they expect from combat without dumbing-down any of the relevant factors.
	All mercenary companies' compositions completely rebalanced to synergize with the cultural tactics relevant to their origin and generally be more effective with regard to Smart Tactics.
	Independence Factions are now far more rowdy.
	2 new Muslim holy orders: 1 Shia (the Saqaliba), and 1 Sunni (the Arsiyah).
	Rebalanced holy order compositions and sizes to fit better in a dynamic levies world (fewer troops) and generally provide no implausible, runaway advantage to Christians, Muslims, or reformed pagans.
	Norse females may lead Norse troops (and serve as marshals). All hail Shield-Maiden Lagertha!
	Updated retinue model. Retinues cost more while reinforcing, and their reinforce rate is as slow as the levy reinforce rate. They have a smaller constant cost.
	Decentralized HRE and Themes System modifiers changed.
	Wars are more unpredictable, generally not decided by single battles, and take longer while allies are far more relevant.
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Lucky Rulers: Assigns a collection of rulers a special, inherited Lucky Ruler trait that ensures they will be interesting to watch and/or rival.
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Resurrected 'Random Rulers,' which applies a new set of random yet coherent traits (incl. all extended traits) to startup rulers and their families (credit to MFCamillus for finding the source of the crash in the old version and adding diplomat trait distribution).
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Vanilla Crusades: players may choose to use the vanilla Crusade mechanic (updated in CKII 2.0) rather than PB's different, custom mechanic.
	Until Charlemagne's promised overhaul of decadence, decadence's positive and negative effects have been completely removed.
		Decadence events, tribal invasions, faction effects, and Decadent trait distribution also disabled.
		Players can simply disregard whatever decadence value their dynasty has, although it should rarely change.
	[Ambition] Pledge Peace for 15 Years (can be repeated)
		Garners immediate vassal opinion and a defensive liege levy boost so long as the pledge is not broken.
		You will be punished if you break the pledge, although it's not particularly easy to accidentally do so (CBs, e.g., will be greyed-out).
		Significant bonuses upon completion.
	[Ambition] Win a War (can be repeated)
	[Ambition] Win a Holy War (can be repeated)
		For both of these ambitions, winning a defensive war also counts, all religious wars count for the latter-- not just Holy War, and all types of war count for the former.
	[Ambition] Find a Hobby
		Increases chances of gaining a lifestyle trait
	Tons of improvements to PB and/or vanilla to reduce event spam/incoherency/immersion-breaking while improving plausibility. Notable examples:
		Doubled the base MTTH for title and marriage begging events.
		Overhauled lifestyle events to be more varied and no longer have wildly differing MTTHs.
		Can no longer gain Craven in battle by totally random event. Likewise, gaining Brave is considerably more rare.
		Holy order recruitment now ignores married characters (unless they're without young children) and whether the holy order was "expelled" from the realm.
		Characters will no longer beg for titles while they're commanding troops during war.
		Characters captured via a siege will now defer any request for mercy for 1 year, after which a 50% longer MTTH applies to mercy requests.
	Tweaks to many vanilla traits for piety gain, lower vassal_opinion impacts, more advantages to previously "bad" traits like Content, etc.
	Republics have been notably de-nerfed-- as part of your realm, while watching them, and while playing as one.
	Chancellor can fabricate claims on duchies with lower diplomacy (as little as 12). Encourages less unlanding of original characters, although it is still unlikely.
	Fabrication of claims is now faster for these cases:
		Faster in capital duchy
		Faster if directly bordering _demesne_ province(s)
	Altered skill curve for councillors that also happens to support job efficacy gains at all skill levels up to and including 30.
	Free Investiture is now more attractive:
		It grants +8 opinion from vassals with bishops and +20 opinion from bishops to their direct lieges.
		Bishops now only inherently like the Pope with +15 opinion rather than +20.
	Royal marriage alliances ("Marriage Ties") yield +40 opinion rather than +30 opinion. Consider marrying your daughters to vassals.
	Lieges no longer inherently dislike faction members, and vassals may join 1 more faction than previously (everybody's in the Autonomy Faction).
	Combat trait advancement (with and without corresponding ambitions selected) is now much more likely from leading troops or winning duels.
	Combat trait advancement ambitions are now half as likely to be selected by the AI.
	Heresy spread should now be more gradual until a religion's authority truly plummets, at which point heresy takeover is more likely.
	Crusades/Jihads can be called with a 40% religious authority minimum, rather than 50%. Other changes to Crusade requirements to more closely follow vanilla.
	Catholic 'Request for Invasion' now more likely to be successful and requires only 40% religious authority, rather than 50%
	Catholic 'Ask for Claim' now more likely to be successful and costs only 50 piety instead of 100
	Serious piety boost for building new temples (i.e., granting them to a bishop), especially count-tier temples
	Minimum amount of de jure territory required to form or usurp an empire dropped to 2/3
	Secondary spouses are now significantly less fertile
	Marriage defines tweaked to deemphasize pro-blobbing unions at the risk of more strange unions (only axis of moddability)
	Takes advantage of the new static modifiers for age groups which were added in CKII 2.1 for modders and no longer uses the "old age" event.
		Ages 0-15:  health -0.5
		Ages 16-19: health +0.5, fertility +5%, sex_appeal_opinion +5, liege_opinion -10 (opinion of liege)
		Ages 20-29: health +0.5, fertility +10%, sex_appeal_opinion +5
		Ages 50-59: health -1.0, fertility -10%, sex_appeal_opinion -5
		Ages 60-99: health -2.0, fertility -15%, sex_appeal_opinion -10
	Councillors may be immediately reassigned.
	Players need only wait 1 year after activation to be able to cancel their ambition.
	De jure territory bonuses/penalties to levies have been significantly "flattened." Closer to a pre-CKII-2.0 setup than previously, it simplifies matters significantly with regard to dynamic levies, and promotes centralization (strong demesne, keeping vassals balkanized, etc.), as it applies to every ruler's capital:
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1.25
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_LEVY_MULT = 1.5
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_LEVY_MULT = 1.25
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.9
		CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.8
		OUTSIDE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		OUTSIDE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.7
	Countless tweaks to PB/vanilla defines and modifiers, significantly changing gameplay behavior.
	An excess of changes that were made to both PB and EMF over the last couple months that need not be duplicated in this log.
