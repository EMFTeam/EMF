EMF 10.4 [2019-11-08]
	*CHANGES:*
		*Christian Syncretism*, *Muslim Syncretism*, *Mazdan Syncretism*, and *Eastern Syncretism* are no longer available in Random Worlds with randomized religion names. This is both due to limitations in the game's localization of religious doctrines and because the specific features common to each religious group cannot be determined ahead of time, making it impossible to have these Syncretism doctrines add these features to the reforming faith.
		Rulers can no longer randomly get *Stressed* from Business focus.
		Modified the effect of councilor attribute scores on the chances of triggering a positive or negative event associated with the job they are doing.
			The modifiers for the chances of triggering a job-related event now range from attribute scores of 0 to 30 (from two sets, one ranging from 0 to 7 and the other from 10 to 22).
			At attribute scores below 10, positive job events are less likely to trigger than before, and negative job events are more likely to trigger than before, though in the case of a councilor with an attribute of 0, negative job events are slightly less likely to trigger than before. The scaling is now more gradual, with the largest (relative) effect at an attribute score of 9, but with the rate of the relative effect increase decreasing at lower attribute scores (from the relative effect starting low with the rate of the effect increase increasing at lower attribute scores).
			At attribute scores above 10, positive job events are less likely to trigger than before until an attribute score of 24 (after which positive job events are more likely to trigger than before), and negative job events are more likely to trigger than before until an attribute score of 25 (after which negative job events are less likely to trigger than before). The scaling is now more gradual, with the largest (relative) effect at an attribute score of 11, but with the rate of the effect increase decreasing at higher attribute scores (from a weird, step-like scaling system before that generally saw the rate of the relative effect increase increasing at higher attribute scores).
		Swaying and Antagonizing:
			NOTE: These changes generally affect the way the AI selects new targets to Sway or Antagonize. Older saves where AI characters have already selected Sway and Antagonize targets will not see these changes reflected until roughly five years of in-game time have passed, at which point the AI characters will usually have reevaluated their Sway and Antagonize targets and picked new ones if their existing ones are no longer suitable.
			*Eunuch* characters can no longer end up becoming lovers through Swaying event chains.
			AI characters with an (player) heir whose education trait could be upgraded through Swaying event chains will now always choose to Sway their heir instead of only if their attribute differences were large enough that an education improvement attempt would generally be successful.
			AI characters will no longer attempt to Sway their unlanded or baron-tier councilors.
			AI characters will now be more lenient with their opinion requirements for selecting a character to Sway, but will only attempt to Sway characters of whom they have a positive opinion already.
			Non-independent AI characters who only have a small pool of characters to choose from for Swaying and Antagonizing will now be less likely to select a character to Sway or Antagonize in the first place.
			Because human players do not have to take their characters' numerical opinion of others into account, AI characters will now only attempt to Sway human players if they would be able to become a friend or a lover of the player through Swaying events (which e.g. requires +60 mutual opinion), or if the human player in question is their heir and the AI could improve the player's education.
		Unit Stats:
			Archers now have 3 Morale (from 1), 1.5 base Melee Attack (from 1), 3 base Melee Defense (from 2), and 1.5 base Pursue Defense (from 2).
			Pikemen now have 0.25 base Skirmish Attack (from 0.1) and 2 base Pursue Attack (from 0.2).
			Horse Archers now have 4 Morale (from 5).
			Camel Cavalry now have 7 Morale (from 8), 1.5 base Skirmish Attack (from 3), 5 base Skirmish Defense (from 6), 8 base Pursue Attack (from 6), and 4 base Pursue Defense (from 3).
			War Elephants now have 20 Morale (from 10), 16 base Skirmish Defense (from 5), 50 base Melee Attack (from 25), 40 base Melee Defense (from 20), 8 base Pursue Attack (from 0.1), and 4 base Pursue Defense.
		Dutch/Frisian/Low Frankish Retinues and Buildings:
			Goedendag Militia is now composed of 200 Pikemen and 50 Light Infantry (from 100 Pikemen and 150 Light Infantry).
			The Goedendag Militia Quarters building line for Castles now gives 70/165/285/430/600/795 Pikemen and 10/30/60/100/150/210 Light Infantry (from 60/145/255/390/550/735 Pikemen and 30/70/120/180/250/330 Light Infantry). For Tribals, they now give 11/24/39/56 Pikemen and 2/6/12/20 Light Infantry (from 10/22/36/53 Pikemen and 4/10/18/26 Light Infantry).
		Combat Tactics:
			Combat Tactics now last for 3 days instead of 5. Besides reducing the penalties to armies with mixed compositions (that arise because each tactic only boosts the stats of some units, so mixed armies will have more unboosted units for any given tactic), this change also offsets the effect of Skirmish tactics boosting Melee stats when the opposing flank changes the flank's phase from Skirmish to Melee.
			Shifted the martial modifiers for getting Devastating, normal, or Failed tactics so that the resulting odds are both more gradual and result in less swingy experienced bonuses/maluses during combat. Characters are now more likely to get Failed tactics and less likely to get Devastating tactics at lower martial, are more likely to get normal tactics at a martial of around 10, and are more likely to get Devastating tactics and less likely to get Failed tactics at higher martial.
			Altered the effects of techs on Combat Tactics. Higher tech levels now also increase the odds of Devastating tactics and increase the odds of selecting a cultural combat tactic, not just decrease the odds of Failed tactics. Failed tactics now also start with higher baseline odds than normal to make the evolution of odds over time smoother. This generally means that techs have a greater effect on combat performance for commanders with average martial than for commanders with exceedingly low or exceptionally high martial.
			Removed Charge on Undefended Flank, primarily because it goes against historical records of armies with an extremely high ratio of archers to non-archers (and without a numbers advantage) winning against armies with more "melee-focused" ratios filled with heavy cavalry.
			Devastating Tactics are disabled for characters with Call to Glory so that they no longer compete with Glorious Tactics.
			Stand Fast Tactics no longer give bonuses to War Elephant Offensive or War Elephant Defensive.
			Charge Tactics now also give +100% War Elephant Offensive.
			Advance Tactics no longer give bonuses to War Elephant Offensive.
			Changed the cultural combat tactic for characters in the Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, and Elephant groups. Instead of Grey Wall Tactic, which gave +50% War Elephant Defensive on top of the regular stats for Stand Fast Tactics, they now have Crushing Charge Tactic, which gives +50% War Elephant Offensive on top of the regular stats of Charge Tactics.
			Closing Charge Tactics now give the same bonuses as baseline Charge Tactics. This means Closing Charge Tactic gives +50% Light Cavalry Offensive (from +25%), +100% Heavy Cavalry Offensive (from +125%), +100% Camel Cavalry Offensive (from +125%), +50% Horse Archer Offensive (from +0%), and +100% War Elephant Offensive (from +75%), and it no longer gives bonuses to Light Infantry Offensive, Heavy Infantry Offensive, or Pikemen Offensive.
			Closing Charge now requires a decent amount of cavalry to perform.
			Last Stand Tactic is now an upgraded form of Glorious Advance Tactic instead of Glorious Shieldwall Tactic.
			Elk's Lament Tactic is now an upgraded form of Glorious Volley Tactic instead of Glorious Shieldwall Tactic.
			Pike Assault Tactic now gives +50% Pikemen Offensive on top of the normal Stand Fast Tactic bonuses instead of +25% Light Infantry Offensive and +25% Light Infantry Defensive on top of the normal Stand Fast Tactic bonuses.
			All cultures that get an upgraded version of Charge Tactics will now get a similarly upgraded version of Closing Charge Tactics.
			New Tactics:
				Closing Advance Tactic is a Skirmish tactic that changes the flank to melee and can fire for flanks that cannot perform Closing Charge Tactic (because they do not have enough cavalry). It gives similar bonuses as Advance Tactics (that are Melee tactics). Cultures that have upgraded versions of Advance Tactics also get upgraded versions of Closing Advance Tactics.
				Pike Square Tactic is a new Skirmish tactic that belongs to the same group as Shieldwall Tactics (so Swarm Tactics deal extra damage to flanks using it). It gives -75% Archer Offensive, -75% Horse Archer Offensive, and -100% Offensive to all other troop types except for Pikemen. However, it gives a +500% Damage bonus against Harass Tactics, a +500% Damage bonus against Closing Charge Tactics, and a +300% Damage bonus against Closing Advance Tactics. This tactic effectively boosts the Skirmish attack of Pikemen to be equal to that of Light Infantry under Harass Tactics, and will cause Pikemen to absolutely slaughter units should the opposing flank use Closing Charge against them.
				Delay Tactic is a new Skirmish tactic that belongs to the same group as Shieldwall Tactics (so Swarm Tactics deal extra damage to flanks using it). It gives no bonuses to any units and gives no bonus Damage against any tactic. It is meant to be the new "default" Skirmish tactic for when a flank is not eligible for better Skirmish tactics.
			Shieldwall Tactic has been overhauled. It now gives -75% Archer Offensive, -75% Horse Archer Offensive, and -100% Offensive to all other troop types (from +50% Pikemen Offensive, +50% Archer Offensive, and +50% Horse Archer Offensive). However, it now also gives +50% Heavy Infantry Defensive and +25% Defensive to all other troop types (from +25% Heavy Infantry Defensive, +25% Pikemen Defensive, +25% Heavy Cavalry Defensive, +25% Archer Defensive, and +25% War Elephant Defensive). It also gives +300% Damage against Harass Tactics (from +100%) and +400% Damage against Closing Advance Tactics; note that these boosts are massive mainly to compensate for the Offensive maluses the tactic normally gives.
			The chances of selecting a combat tactic that switches the flank from Skirmish to Melee phase is now influenced more heavily by troop composition (armies with more Heavy Cavalry, War Elephants, Heavy Infantry, and/or Pikemen will be more likely to select it, armies with more Archers and/or Horse Archers will be less likely to select it) and is also now influenced by terrain (Plains, Farmlands, and Steppes are easier to advance over, while Forest, Mountains, Jungle, and Marshes are harder to advance over).
			Roman Triple Line combat tactics will now only give an extra +25% Heavy Infantry Offensive and +25% Heavy Infantry Defensive (from +50% and +50%) on top of the normal bonuses of the Advance combat tactics. This brings them in line with the bonuses of other cultural combat tactics.
		Bloodlines:
			The Blood of Bayajidda and Magajiva bloodline can now be inherited from fathers as well as mothers. This will allow the *Enatic-Cognatic*-enabling effect to actually be useful, as having a male ruler disrupt a line of female rulers will no longer cause the bloodline to be lost in the next generation of rulers, therefore allowing *Enatic-Cognatic* to be kept even if a generation happens to be male.
			The bloodline of Alexander Nevsky now applies to all cultures in the East Slavic cultural group, not just Russian. In practice, by the time the bloodline exists, all East Slavic characters and provinces in the game are Russian, but this does benefit users of the Ruler Designer and/or modders who wish to add cultures to the East Slavic group and/or split up Russian.
			The bloodline gained by founding Lechczechrus will now only be active for characters in the East Slavic and West Slavic cultural groups.
			The Blood of Alexander the Great bloodline can now only be founded by characters in the Latin, Italian (with SWMH), Byzantine, or Arabic cultural groups, and can only be founded if the character's religion is Christian, Muslim, or Hellenic. Once founded, it is also now only active for characters who continue to satisfy those conditions.
			The Blood of Ashoka bloodline can no longer be founded by Taoist characters, and is now only active for characters with a Dharmic religion (i.e. Eastern group without Taoist).
			The bloodline gained for adopting a Chinese Imperial government is now only active for characters who belong to cultures that are eligible for Chinese Imperial government.
		Added a new succession law called *Pictish Elective*. It is only available for Pictish characters, who also no longer have access to *Tanistry* by virtue of their culture alone. It is the starting succession law for the Kingdom of Pictland in the 769 start (available without SWMH), though due to lack of history data for the female relatives of the rulers of the Kingdom of Pictland, it will take some time before the interesting aspects of the succession law become relevant. *Pictish Elective* is a blend of *Tanistry* and *Feudal Elective* that also has its own, Pictish peculiarities.
			Direct vassals of the ruler and their vassals are electors, just like under *Tanistry*.
			Each elector has one vote, and outside of peculiarities specific to *Pictish Elective*, electors will score candidates the same way they would under *Feudal Elective*.
			Only characters who belong to the same dynasty as the current ruler or who are related to any current or previous ruler through a direct female line (e.g. uterine sibling, nibling through the ruler's sister, grandchild through the ruler's daughter, cousin through the ruler's mother's uterine sister, etc.) are eligible as candidates.
			Electors will prefer electing a candidate who is related to any current or previous ruler through a direct female line over those who are not. They will also not prefer to elect a candidate who is an immediate child of the current ruler.
		[SWMH] Removed all cultural static unit modifiers. Cultural influences on units are represented enough by cultural buildings, cultural retinues, and cultural combat tactics.
		Added a new game rule called *Sway and Antagonize* with three options: *Allowed*, *Players Only*, and *Disallowed*. Since Sway and Antagonize are features of Holy Fury, this rule will only appear when playing with Holy Fury enabled.
			*Allowed* enables Sway and Antagonize for all rulers, AI included. It is the default option. It can increase immersion, but allowing the AI to Sway and Antagonize can slow down the game down somewhat for arguably little gain.
				NOTE: Sway event spam has been fixed regardless of this option, so human players won't be bombarded with Sway attempts by the AI anyway. However, the game will run slower regardless because AI rulers still have to intermittently check their Sway/Antagonize targets for eligibility and/or select new targets, even if they are now more cautious about selecting humans.
			*Players Only* allows only human players to use Sway and Antagonize actions. This can potentially create an uneven playing field due to how powerful these actions can be in the right hands.
			*Disallowed* disables Sway and Antagonize for all rulers, players included.
		The monastic society decision to remove *Celibate* now requires having taken the monastic society decision to become *Celibate*, i.e. it now cannot remove *Celibate* that has been granted from any source other than the monastic society decision to become *Celibate*.
		Upon formation of the Saint-Empire Romain (western version of the HRE), the Empire-tier *Germania* title will now become available for creation even if the rule *Ahistorical De Jure Empires* is set to *Off* (default). In the case that it's set to *Off*, it will of course only be a titular title to start, however.
		Seduction and Gaining Lovers:
			The AI will no longer take Seduction focus if it would never select a seduction target.
			All characters are now able to seduce their children, their grandchildren, their parents, and their grandparents.
			Standardized reactions to incest across all instances of seduction and events that can cause characters to become lovers. Now, if an AI character does not truly follow a religion where incest is allowed, they will now potentially still be personally OK with engaging in incest in case of the following:
				The AI character has the *Voice of Satan* modifier.
				The AI character is *Lustful*, *Hedonist*, *Possessed*, or *Lunatic*, they are not *Zealous*, and they have a zeal of 40 or lower (this generally means a lack of pious traits).
				The AI character is *Arbitrary*, they are not *Zealous*, and they have a zeal of 0 or lower (this generally means a severe lack of pious traits and/or the presence of traits like *Cynical*).
			Standardized AI reactions to being suggested to engage in incest when their true religion does not encourage it. Now, AI characters will always be 75% less likely than normal to accept the offer if they are OK with engaging in incest despite their religion, and they will never accept the offer if they are not OK with engaging in incest.
			Male AI characters with Seduction focus and with lots of children will no longer be less likely to seduce other characters. Instead, female AI characters with Seduction focus and with lots of children will be less likely to seduce male characters.
			Standardized the requirements for two characters wanting to engage in a romantic relationship, which should make lover relationships more plausible. Previously, besides the matching of sexual preferences, other requirements such as minimum opinions and not being rivals were very inconsistent. Now, a character can be romantically interested in another character all of the following are met, and most lover-acquisition related events require both characters to have a possible romantic interest in each other:
				They are not rivals or lovers (lovers are excluded because it's assumed separately that a character is always romantically interested in their lovers).
				The target character's gender matches the given character's sexual preferences.
				The target character is not too old to have children.
				The target character is not a close relative, or the given character is OK with incest.
				The given character likes the target character enough, which means one of:
					They have 45 or more opinion of the target.
					They have 20 or more opinion of the target and are *Lustful*, are a teenager, or are the same gender as their target and both they and the target are *Homosexual*.
					They have 0 or more opinion of the target and are controlled by a human player. Note: this will only affect random events and does not affect players' ability to use Seduction on targets that their in-game character hates.
					They have an opinion modifier of the target that indicates infatuation (acquired through various events).
	*FIXES:*
		Non-cultural Raid combat tactics will now properly give +50%/+75%/+100% Camel Cavalry Offensive to match the bonus given to Light Cavalry Offensive.
		The game will no longer slow down every 4 in-game days.
		Fixed the names and descriptions for *Christian Syncretism*, *Muslim Syncretism*, *Mazdan Syncretism*, and *Eastern Syncretism*.
		AI characters with low rationality will now properly be more likely to frequently switch Sway and/or Antagonize targets, and AI characters with high rationality will now properly be more likely to stick with the same Sway and/or Antagonize target for a long period of time.
		AI characters can no longer Sway their religious heads, mirroring the same limitations that human players have.
		The event that grants *Raider* will now properly no longer trigger for characters who could get *Viking* or *Pirate* through bloodlines and/or their religion, and will no longer trigger for characters who have *Viking*, *Pirate*, *Ravager*, *Sea King*, or *Sea Queen*.
		The events that decide what happens to titles after a non-Holy Fury crusade is won will now properly recognize the need to disqualify males if the winner's primary title has *Enatic* or *Enatic-Cognatic* succession.
		The Blood of Gopala historical bloodline is now properly active for characters in the Indo-Aryan group.
		[SWMH] Added conditional triggers to the historical bloodlines that were previously missing them.
		Upon formation of the Saint-Empire Romain (western version of the HRE), de jure territory reassignment to the Empire will now correctly work as in past versions.
		The event for a sympathizer of a newly revealed secret religious community to also switch their religion to that of the newly revealed society will now work properly when triggered for human players.
		When receiving the Duchy of Normandy through the event where a Norse Pagan ruler of Norse or Norman culture in the British Isles, Brittany, or France offers to convert to Christianity and become a vassal of a King or Emperor who has imprisoned them, is attacking them, or has a vassal attacking them, the newly converted ruler will now only get the Duchy of Normandy if their capital is already inside its de jure territory. If they are granted the Duchy of Normandy, they will now also no longer get claims on the titles belonging de jure to the duchy that are held by characters either not in the realm of their new liege or who are already vassals of the newly converted character.
	*VANILLA FIXES:*
		Business focus' random events now trigger with the same consistency and timing as the random events that belong to other focuses.
		Build Cost and Time Modifiers:
			The build cost and time modifiers on the Lost Architecture Book artifact now work properly.
			The build cost modifier on the Master Builder character modifier now works properly.
			The Inspired Peasents character modifier gained from the Jashn-e-Sadeh event chain's *Administrator* option now properly reduces build times.
			The build cost modifier on the Friendly Innovations province modifier now works properly.
		In cases where the bear event chain targets a character whose graphical culture is not their culture's default graphical culture, the option to undo the change now properly reverts the character's graphical culture back to their original.
		Great work upgrades that can store religious artifacts will now properly activate when an artifact is stored in them.
		Fixed many cases for random target selection in events. In some of these target selection procedures, the game would look at the wrong character when checking the relations of the character it is currently evaluating.
		Crossing a strait will now apply penalties to Camel Cavalry Offensive, Camel Cavalry Defensive, War Elephant Offensive, and War Elephant Defensive, just like for all other troop types.
		[Vanilla Map] The kingdom titles meant to be created if Thankmar wins his rebellion against Otto can now no longer be created outside of that event.
		[Vanilla Map] The Kingdom of Pictland will now properly have *Free Investiture* in the 769 start.
		If playing with Holy Fury, the Pope will now properly wait for crusader participants to get to their destination if the crusade target is far away from them before sending out angry letters to rulers who he doesn't think are participating in the crusade.
		Pagan Reformation God Names:
			Fixed an issue where reformed pagan religions with (evil) god lists different from the default (evil) god lists would have their (evil) god names smooshed together upon loading a save game.
				Due to limitations in the implementation of this fix, older save games with reformed religions with *Holy Family* will not have their reformer's family re-added to their god lists.
			Reforming Tengri, Romuva, or Aztec with *Dogmatic* and either *Agnatic Clans* or *Enatic Clans* will now properly no longer add any extra gods beyond the high god.
			Reforming Aztec with *Proselytizing* will no longer completely remove the names of all good gods the way *Dogmatic* does, and reforming Aztec with both *Proselytizing* and *Agnatic Clans* will now properly set Quetzalcoatl as the high god instead of Huitzilopochtli, and set Tezcatlipoca as an evil god instead of a good god (the same thing that would happen when reforming with *Proselytizing* but without *Agnatic Clans* or *Enatic Clans*).
			Reforming with both *Dogmatic* and *Holy Family* will no longer add anyone besides the reformer to the religion's god list.
			When reforming with *Agnatic Clans* and *Holy Family* without *Dogmatic*, the reformer's female children and siblings can no longer become gods.
			Fixed an issue where reforming Hellenic with *Dogmatic* would not properly add the name of the high god to the religion's god list.
			When reforming with *Holy Family*, *Dogmatic*, *Temporal*, and either *Agnatic Clans* or *Enatic Clans* or when inheriting the religious head title with such doctrines, the character will only become a high god if their gender matches the gender preference of their doctrines.
			When a religion's reformer's child becomes a god when reforming with *Holy Family* and without *Dogmatic*, the child's original parents are also added as gods if they have not already been added.
			When a character inherits a religious head title with *Holy Family*, *Dogmatic*, and *Temporal* and becomes the religion's high god as a result, they are also added to the religion's god list, and the old god list is completely cleared.
		Patrician members of Warrior Lodges whose only holding is their Family Palace will no longer be falsely detected as unlanded characters when being assigned a mission.
		Landed members of Warrior Lodges with coastal capitals can now be tasked to wage war against a ruler for a province that is coastal and close enough to march to on land, but that would require too long of a trip by sea.
		If a non-independent title with *Tanistry* has its external inheritance restricted, landed characters from outside the title's realm can no longer be succession candidates.
		The event where a landless claimant to a title moves to the court of a ruler who is Antagonizing the current holder of the title will now work properly.
		DLC Religion Warnings:
			When playing with Holy Fury but without The Old Gods, the game no longer displays warnings for converting to a religion in the Pagan group and/or becoming a non-nomadic character with a religion in the Pagan group.
			When playing with Jade Dragon but without The Old Gods, the game no longer displays warnings for converting to Bön (reformed or unreformed) and/or becoming a non-nomadic Bön character.
			When playing with Rajas of India but without Jade Dragon, the game no longer displays warning for converting to Taoist and/or becoming a non-nomadic Taoist character.
		Great Works can now be looted more than once per game.
		Burned Heart Point Bonuses for Ritual Sacrifices:
			Extra Burned Heart points earned for ritually sacrificing a foreign Emperor and/or a foreign religious head now properly apply when the person being sacrificed is an Emperor and/or a religious head, not when the person doing the sacrificing is one of those.
			Extra Burned Heart points earned for sacrificing your child now properly apply if the child is not an adult, not if you are not an adult.
			Extra Burned Heart points earned for sacrificing a child of your religion when your religion also has *Holy Family* now properly only apply when sacrificing your children and only if the child's parents are/were close relatives.
		When a Devil Worshiper is selected to induct a character into the society by seduction, they are now guaranteed to be someone who the character does not know, guaranteed to be beautiful, and guaranteed to have sexual preferences that correspond to those of the inductee.
		[Vanilla Map] Added missing entries for the Sloveini and Sardinian cultures in the definitions used by the EU4 converter.
		When attempting to forge a bloodline based on family, the option to focus on researching living members of the character's dynasty will now properly end up giving characters *Kind* if they do not have it already.
		Great Works Traps upgrades will no longer trigger their kill effect if the Great Work's owner changes without a change in administration (read: if it is not part of a foreign conquest), and they will not trigger if a previous owner of the Great Work containing the Traps re-conquers it.
	*MODDING:*
		Cultural eligibility for the adoption of Chinese Imperial governments is now controlled by a single scripted trigger that can be more easily overwritten.
		The scripted effect `reformation_god_names_changes_effect` has been changed so that it is assumed to fire from the scope of the (reformed) religion. You may now scope to the religion's reformer, alive or dead, by scoping to the religion and then scoping to `persistent_event_target:reformer`.
		Dummy religion characters in Isis' court are no longer saved as global event targets in the naming format `emf_global_<religion>_dummy`. Instead, they are saved as persistent event targets in their corresponding religions as `emf_religion_dummy_character`, i.e., they can be referenced by `persistent_event_target:emf_religion_dummy_character` from within a religion's scope. This should make it easier to reference the dummy character belonging to a character, province, or title religion without having to know the specific religion ahead of time.
		The cultural triggers for cultural castle buildings, cultural tribal buildings, Gompa Monastery buildings, and Radhanite Quarter buildings have now been outsourced to scripted triggers in `common/scripted_triggers/emf_buildings_triggers.txt`. This allows for easier modification of these buildings' cultural requirements without having to modify data of the buildings themselves.


EMF 10.3 [2019-10-24]
	*CHANGES:*
		Compatibility patch for CKII v3.3.0.
		China Grace Decisions:
			Being both liked and disliked by China will now give 100 grace when sending horses to China (from 150) and will deduct 100 grace when deciding to no longer send horses to China (from 150).
			The AI will now consider the Chinese Emperor's/Empress' likes and dislikes when deciding to send gifts, horses, and/or people to China.
			The AI will no longer send close relatives or councillors to China.
		Two-handed swords can now be used by characters with *Burly* if they do not have *Robust*, *Giant*, or 20 combat rating.
		Factions:
			AI characters can now form claimant factions against titles with *Imperial Elective* succession where the supported claimant is also the current heir. They could previously do so only for titles with *Feudal Elective* or *Princely Elective* succession.
			AI characters with strong claims on titles can now potentially support factions supporting strong claimants, though they are unlikely to do so unless there is already some support for them (the same way characters with weak claims are less likely to support weak claimants).
			AI characters now give extra support to claimants that share their culture and religion if their liege belongs to their cultural group and religious group but is considered hostile to their religion the same way they would if their liege did not belong to their cultural group or did not belong to their religious group.
			Independence:
				AI characters following pacifist religions can now create and join Independence factions, though they will do so more reluctantly than if they were not pacifist.
				AI characters who are duke tier or lower, belong to a reformed religion, are the same religion as their liege, are in the same cultural group but are not the same culture as their liege, and are fairly close to their liege are no longer blocked from creating or joining Independence factions. Instead, AI characters who are duke tier or lower, belong to a reformed religion, and are fairly close to their liege will now be blocked from creating or joining Independence factions if they are in the same cultural group as their liege, are in the same religious group as their liege, are not considered religiously hostile to their liege, and either are the same religion as their liege but not the same culture or are the same culture as their liege but not the same religion.
		Offensive, Unreformed Pagan Unit Modifiers:
			Nomadic characters following unreformed versions of the Germanic, Tengri, and Aztec faiths will now get +15% maximum manpower. This is to compensate for the fact that nomadic characters would not benefit from those religions' +30% levy size modifier.
			Unreformed Germanic characters no longer get +50% retinue size.
			Unreformed Tengri characters no longer get +30% light cavalry offense and +30% light cavalry defense.
			Unreformed Zun characters no longer get +20% heavy infantry offense and +20% heavy infantry defense.
		Religious Doctrines:
			NOTE: Unless otherwise indicated, all changes to religious doctrines listed here will not apply to religions that were already reformed in an older savefile. This is due to limitations in how pagan reformation is implemented.
			AI characters following a religion with the *Peaceful* or *Cosmopolitan* doctrine will now attempt to convert all other religions if their zeal is high. Previously, they would never attempt to convert any other religions.
			AI characters following a religion with the *Warmongering* doctrine will now attempt to convert religions outside of the Pagan group if their zeal is high. Previously, they would never attempt to convert religions outside of the Pagan group.
			AI characters following a religion with the *Dogmatic* doctrine will now always attempt to convert religions outside of the Pagan group. Previously, they would never attempt to convert religions outside of the Pagan group.
			*Unyielding*, *Proselytizing*, *Dogmatic*, and *Cosmopolitan* no longer enable looting for Aztec, Hellenic, and Zun/Zunbil religions (i.e. religions that do not have it enabled by default).
			*Daring* has been disabled and its benefits have been moved to other doctrines. Prepared invasions are now enabled by *Warmongering* and the ability to become notorious raiders has been moved to *Sea-Bound*.
			*Syncretism* has been disabled and its effects have been moved to *Cosmopolitan*.
			New doctrines:
				*Mercantile*
					Characters who follow a religion with *Mercantile* have their Stewardship increased by 2. If playing with Reaper's Due, provinces who follow a religion with *Mercantile* will prosper as if they had a trade post.
				*Christian Syncretism*
					Enables ancestor veneration, makes priests celibate, and allows characters to be sent to become ascetics.
					Enables intermarrying with all religions in the Christian group, even if the religion has *Dogmatic*.
					Characters who follow a religion with *Christian Syncretism* are tolerant towards others in the Christian religious group.
					Disables religious wars against members of the Christian group.
					Conversion to and from religions in the Christian group is faster.
					Incompatible with *Monasticism*, *Religious Tax*, *Bloodthirsty Gods*, and *Invaders*.
					Requires either a Christian neighboring ruler, a Christian lord in the realm, a nearby, independent Christian ruler, or the presence of a Christian holy site in the realm.
				*Muslim Syncretism*
					Enables polygamy.
					Enables intermarrying with all religions in the Muslim group, even if the religion has *Dogmatic*.
					Characters who follow a religion with *Muslim Syncretism* are tolerant towards others in the Muslim religious group.
					Disables religious wars against members of the Muslim group.
					Conversion to and from religions in the Muslim group is faster.
					Incompatible with *Polygamy*, *Religious Tax*, *Bloodthirsty Gods*, and *Invaders*.
					Requires either a Muslim neighboring ruler, a Muslim lord in the realm, a nearby, independent Muslim ruler, or the presence of a Muslim holy site in the realm.
				*Mazdan Syncretism*
					Enables divine blood mechanics and incestous marriages.
					Enables intermarrying with all religions in the Mazdan group, even if the religion has *Dogmatic*.
					Characters who follow a religion with *Mazdan Syncretism* are tolerant towards others in the Mazdan religious group.
					Disables religious wars against members of the Mazdan group.
					Conversion to and from religions in the Mazdan group is faster.
					Incompatible with *Divine Marriage*, *Religious Tax*, *Bloodthirsty Gods*, and *Invaders*.

				*Eastern Syncretism*
					Removes short reign penalty and enables Meliorism mechanics.
					Enables intermarrying with all religions in the Eastern group, even if the religion has *Dogmatic*.
					Characters who follow a religion with *Eastern Syncretism* are tolerant towards others in the Eastern religious group.
					Disables religious wars against members of the Eastern group.
					Conversion to and from religions in the Eastern group is faster.
					Incompatible with *Stability*, *Religious Tax*, *Bloodthirsty Gods*, and *Invaders*.
					Requires either an Eastern neighboring ruler, an Eastern lord in the realm, a nearby, independent Eastern ruler, or the presence of an Eastern holy site in the realm.
			*Unyielding*:
				No longer gives +20% levy size.
				Is now mutually exclusive with *Eternal Riders* and *Invaders* the same way it is mutually exclusive with *Unrelenting* (whose features are incorporated into both of those doctrines).
				No longer has access to great holy wars.
			*Warmongering*
				Now also gives +45% levy size and +22.5% maximum manpower. This allows offensive, unreformed pagans to not only keep their unit bonuses on reformation, but also improve upon them the same way defensive, unreformed pagans can improve upon their bonuses with *Unyielding*.
				Now enables Prepared Invasions, something that previously required *Daring*.
				AI characters whose true religion has *Warmongering* are now more likely to create and join factions. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames.
			*Cosmopolitan*:
				Now also enables the decision to gain religious sympathy traits that previously required *Syncretism*. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames.
				Now mutually exclusive with *Religious Tax*.
				No longer has access to great holy wars.
			*Ancestor Veneration*:
				*Religious Tax* no longer affects a character's chances of becoming venerated. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames.
				*Meritocracy* no longer affects a character's chances of becoming venerated. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames.
				Under a religion that has both polygamy and divine blood mechanics, characters will no longer have a lower chance of becoming venerated if they ever marry someone who is not of their dynasty, only if they never marry anyone of their dynasty. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames.
				Being Chaste will no longer lower a character's chances of becoming venerated if the religion has polygamy. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames.
				AI religious heads no longer have a 50% chance of rejecting a candidate for ancestor veneration. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames.
			*Proselytizing*:
				No longer causes piety loss when at war with someone of the same religion.
				Can now be taken with *Bloodthirsty Gods*.
			*Religious Tax*:
				Now also enables the passive religious conversion of infidel provinces that was previously restricted to religions in the Muslim group. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames.
				If taken with *Proselytizing* or *Dogmatic*, AI characters will only attempt to convert religions from other religion groups it their zeal is high instead of always. This mimics AI behavior in the Muslim religious group and allows the AI to make better use of religious taxes.
			Religion-specific doctrines:
				*Defenders of Dievas* now also includes the beatification feature that would be present under *Ancestor Veneration*. It is now mutually exclusive with *Ancestor Veneration* and can now be taken with *Meritocracy*. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames.
				Adulthood rites and pervasive adult tattooing are no longer an inherent part of a reformed West African pagan religion. Instead, *Totem-Guardians* now incorporates the features of *Animistic*, which includes adulthood rites and pervasive adult tattooing, and no longer incorporates the features of *Religious Tax*. *Animistic* is now also available on its own for West African pagan reformation should a character not want to take *Totem-Guardians* for some reason. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames, though the doctrine will still retain its features of *Religious Tax*.
				*Dawnbreakers* now incorporates the features of *Meritocracy*, i.e. heir designation, instead of the features of *Divine Marriage*, i.e. divine blood mechanics and incestous marriages. It is now mutually exclusive with *Meritocracy* instead of with *Divine Marriage*. This properly reflects the fact that the Zun/Zunbil religion was most similar to the Hindu, Buddhist, and Bön religions, all of which either feature or lean towards heir designation in-game.
				Bloodthirsty and prisoner sacrifice mechanics are no longer an inherent part of a reformed Aztec religion; they must now take the *Invaders* (the Aztec-specific doctrine) or *Bloodthirsty Gods* doctrines to unlock them. *Bloodthirsty Gods* is now also available on its own for Aztec reformation should a character not want to take *Invaders* (e.g. because *Invaders* cannot be taken with *Unyielding*). This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames.
				*Invaders* is now mutually exclusive with *Peaceful* due to incorporating features from *Unrelenting* and *Bloodthirsty Gods*, both of which are mutually exclusive with *Peaceful*.
				*Children of Perun* now incorporates the features of *Ancestor Veneration*, i.e. beatification and *Eldership* succession, instead of allowing for river movement. It is now mutually exclusive with the *Ancestor Veneration* doctrine due to this. Players who want river movement as a reformed Slavic/Slavianska Vera pagan will now need to take *Sea-Bound*. This properly reflects the importance of ancestry in the Slavic/Slavianska Vera pagan religion. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames, though the doctrine will still retain its feature that allows for river movement.
				*Survivors of Ukko* and *Defenders of Dievas* now incorporate the features of *Animistic*, i.e. adulthood rites and a morale boost, instead of setting the religions as ones that are hard to convert. They are now mutually exclusive with the *Animistic* doctrine due to this. Players who want their reformed Suomenusko/Muinaisusko/Romuva religion to be hard to convert will now need to take *Unyielding* or *Dogmatic*. In the case of *Survivors of Ukko*, this represents the animistic nature of the Finnish pagan religion, while in the case of *Defenders of Dievas*, this is a rough approximation of the religion's nature-worship. Already-reformed religions with this doctrine in older savegames will retain their original features, but will also unlock adulthood rites.
				*Invaders* no longer grants river movement because overseas Aztecs would have ships built for deep waters, not necessarily narrow ones.
				*Invaders* is no longer mutually exclusive with *Sea-Bound*.
				*Sons of Ragnarok* now incorporates the features of *Mercantile* and no longer enables Prepared Invasions. It is also mutually exclusive with *Mercantile*. Players who want Prepared Invasions as a reformed Germanic pagan will now need to take *Warmongering*.
				*Sons of Ragnarok* is now mutually exclusive with *Peaceful* due to incorporating features from *Sea-Bound*, which is incompatible with *Peaceful*.
				Star signs, access to the Hermetic society, and divinations are no longer an inherent part of a reformed Hellenic religion. Instead, *Civilized* now incorporates the features of both *Astrology* and *Haruspicy* and no longer enables the decision to take Sympathy traits. *Astrology* and *Haruspicy* are now also available on their own for Hellenic reformation should a character not want to take *Civilized* for some reason. *Civilized* can now be taken with *Dogmatic*. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames.
				*Civilized* no longer removes vassal opinion penalties for raised levies. Players who want access to this feature will need to take *Warmongering*.
			*Pyramid Creation* will now never be taken by AI reformers.
			Modifers gained from going through adulthood rites that are a part of *Animistic*, *Totem-Guardians*, and *Survivor of Ukko* no longer have any negative effects. This also applies to already-reformed religions in older savegames.
			*Polygamy*, *Dawnbreakers*, and *Eternal Riders* now also allow women to take up to 3 male consorts if not paired with *Agnatic Clans* and do not disallow women from taking consorts for religions that already allow it. This is to compensate for the hardcoded issue of the polygamy mechanic only applying to male characters. *Polygamy* is also no longer incompatible with *Enatic Clans*.
		Zun/Zunbil Religion:
			Zun/Zunbil characters no longer get inherent access to the Hermetic society.
			Zun/Zunbil and Reformed Zun/Zunbil religions now have the same caste system that the Hindu religion does due to Zunbil "paganism" actually being mostly Hindu in origin.
			Zun/Zunbil now has the modifiers of a defensive pagan religion instead of those of an offensive one. This is in line with their historical, guerilla warfare approach to defeating Muslim invaders.
			Tribal Zun/Zunbil characters now have access to the Ardent Guardians and Sworn Defenders retinues. 
		Only characters following either the reformed or the unreformed West African religion will get tattoos from going through adulthood rites tied to the *Animistic* doctrine.
		Devil Worshipers:
			Characters following Buddhist, Jain, Taoist, Bön, or Reformed Bön religions or secret religions can now join the Cult of Kali. They previously had no access to devil worshiper societies.
			Characters with Hindu as their secret religion can now also join the Cult of Kali.
			Characters with Christian, Muslim, Israelite, Mazdan, Zun/Zunbil, or Reformed Zun/Zunbil as their secret religion can now also join the Satanists.
			Added a new devil worshiper society called The Followers of Ahuiateteo. It functions like other devil worshiper societies, but is available for characters following the reformed or unreformed version of the Aztec religion.
		Sunset Invasion:
			Added an Aztec warrior lodge society called *The Jaguar Warriors*. It currently functions like all other warrior lodge societies without any special, Aztec-specific powers.
			Added a new combat tactic called "Water Fire Tactic". It is unlocked by using the *Call to Glory* power while in *The Jaguar Warriors* and functions as an upgraded version of the *Glorious Advance* tactic.
			Added a new leader trait called *Chosen of the Jaguar*. It is unlocked through being in *The Jaguar Warriors*, adds morale offense and morale defense, adds specialization to the *Jungle* terrain type, and increases the chance of imprisoning opponents during battle events.
			Aztec characters can now receive foreign missionaries before 1350 if it has been 50 years since their arrival.
		Looting an infidel temple:
			Now only gives -1% Religious Authority for 4 years instead of 20 years to the *looted* (defender) religion.
			Now only gives +1% Religious Authority for 4 years instead of 10 years to the *looting* (attacker) religion.
		Building a temple now gives +2% Religious Authority for 15 years instead of +1% for 20 years.
		Pagan Reformation:
			Now requires 45% Religious Authority (from 30% in prior versions; vanilla is 50%).
			Now requires 1500 piety cost (from vanilla's setting of 750).
		Prepared Invasions:
			Now require 2000 prestige (up from 750) and cost 1500 of it.
			Now require 500 piety and cost all of it.
			Now require 100 gold and cost all of it.
			Event troop spawns are now hard-capped at the attacker having 2.25x the defender's troops instead of 4x (unless the attacker is a *Lucky Ruler*, and then the old 4x cap still applies).
				Consequently, the schedule of reducing the frequency of such troop spawn events also now becomes increasingly less frequent when the attacker has at least 1.25x the defender's troop count.
		Imperial Decay:
			Usurpations now increase decay more than previously, especially if it was an intra-dynastic imperial usurpation.
			Consecutive ruling dynasty member count for the Empire is now tracked for all different ways in which the empire title could be transferred.
		The *Independence Faction* is now considerably more rowdy for tribal or nomadic lieges.
		Added a new employment decision called *Present Bachelor*. It is functionally identical to *Present Debutante* but spawns a male courtier instead of a female one. It can be taken by rulers who are not guaranteed a male character by other employment decisions, i.e., by rulers with gender equality or *Enatic Clans*.
		If playing without Holy Fury, reformed religions whose Holy Fury special doctrines enable *Eldership* succession now get access to *Eldership* succession.
		AI characters will now raid other characters that are in the same religious group.
		Feudal and Merchant Republic leaders who are unreformed pagans can now also request mass baptisms.
		Tribal Governments:
			No longer get a +2 demesne bonus.
			Tribal AI vassals are no longer more likely than normal to accept calls to arms. 
			Tribal, unreformed Romuva rulers no longer start with or have access to *Eldership* succession. This both helps with gameplay balance and is more historically accurate, as there is proof that Baltic pagan rulers sometimes split their territory upon succession.
			*Tribal Organization* laws no longer enable free infidel revocation at higher levels.
		Characters with secret religions can now be the target of Evoke Sympathy missions.
		The event where a mother chokes on their communion and reveals that their baby is a bastard can now only trigger if the baby's father is not actually their real father.
		Swaying and Antagonizing:
			*Lunatic* characters can now also attempt to sway rivals.
			AI characters can now end up swaying and/or antagonizing the same target. Previously, being the target of a swaying or antagonizing action would make a character immune to swaying and antagonizing from all other AI characters.
			Instead of always reseting sway and antagonize targets every 5 years, AI characters will now consider reseting their target every year, with the chance of reseting depending on their rationality and whether they find a new, suitable target for their sway/antagonize action.
			AI characters will no longer sway or antagonize characters who would be ineligible for swaying or antagonizing by human players (e.g. AI characters can no longer sway rivals unless they have *Arbitrary* or *Lunatic*).
			AI characters are now much smarter about who they choose to antagonize. They are now able to antagonize rulers who are their vassals, have the same direct liege, are neighboring, independent rulers, or are marked as foes, and they will only antagonize rivals if they can be dueled and believe they would have an advantage against them in duels. They will also prefer to antagonize characters who they already dislike and will not antagonize characters of whom they have a positive opinion or who are their lovers, friends, or children. Previously, AI characters would antagonize random rulers in their realm without a clear pattern.
			AI characters are now much smarter about who they choose to sway. They will focus on swaying their (player) heir if they have the same education type and there is a decent chance of them improving their heir's education through swaying. Otherwise, they can attempt to sway their councillors, their (player) heir, their vassals, any of their lieges, rulers who are under the same liege, their rightful religious head, neighboring, independent rulers, and rulers who are antagonizing them but of whom they do not have a negative opinion. They will not sway characters who are already their friend, lover, or rival unless that character is their (player) heir whose education trait they can improve. They will prefer to sway characters who they already like and characters who are antagonizing them but of whom they have a positive opinion. Previously, AI characters would attempt to sway random characters in their realm who were either their vassals, their courtiers, their heirs, or councillors of other rulers.
			AI characters who become unlanded while still in the process of swaying and/or antagonizing someone will stop swaying and/or antagonizing until they become landed again.
		Artifacts and event modifiers that alter global levy size now also alter maximum manpower for nomads by half of the levy size modifier.
		Nomadic Capital Buildings:
			The Hunting Parties line now increases population growth by 1%/2%/3%/5%/7%/9%/12%/15% instead of increasing horse archer offensive.
			Cattle Pens VII and VIII now increase population growth and nomad tax by 12% and 15% respectively (from 11% and 14%).
			The Riding Contests line now increases manpower growth by 2%/4%/7%/10%/15%/20%/30%/40% instead of increasing light cavalry offensive and heavy cavalry offensive.
			Clan Gathering Hall V, VI, VII, and VII now increase clan sentiment by 11, 14, 17, and 20 respectively (from 10, 13, 16, and 19).
			The Camel Breeder, Elephant Camp, and Horse Breeder lines have been combined into a single building line called War Mount Breeder. This new building increases light cavalry offensive, heavy cavalry offensive, camel cavalry offensive, and war elephants offensive by 5%/10%/16%/23%/31%/40%/50%/60%.
			The Composite Bow line now increases horse archer offensive and archer offensive by 5%/10%/16%/23%/31%/40%/50%/60% (from 10%/20%/30%/40%/50%/60%/70%/80%).
			Wrestling VII and VIII now increases morale by 26% and 30% respectively (from 25% and 28%).
			The Shrine line now increases population growth by 1%/2%/3%/5%/7%/9%/12%/15% (from 3%/6%/9%/12%/15%/18%/21%/24%).
			Baghatur Council V, VI, VII, and VIII now increase morale by 11%, 14%, 17%, and 20% (from 10%, 12%, 15%, and 18%).
			Harbor VIII now increases nomad tax by 20% (from 21%).
		Nomadic Religious Retinues:
			Bolghar Auxiliaries are now composed of 250 horse archers (from 125 horse archers and 125 archers). They no longer give bonuses to archer offensive or archer defensive.
			Keraite Auxiliaries are now composed of 100 heavy cavalry and 150 horse archers (from 125 pikemen and 125 horse archers). They now give +25% heavy cavalry defensive instead of +25% pikemen defensive.
			Parthian Auxiliaries are now composed of 50 heavy cavalry and 200 horse archers (from 125 heavy infantry and 125 horse archers). They now give +25% heavy cavalry defensive instead of +25% heavy infantry defensive.
			Khazarian Auxiliaries are now composed of 50 heavy cavalry and 200 light cavalry (from 125 heavy infantry and 125 light cavalry). They now give +25% heavy cavalry defensive instead of +25% heavy infantry defensive.
			Khitan Auxiliaries are now composed of 250 light cavalry (from 125 light infantry and 125 light cavalry). They no longer give bonuses to light infantry offensive or light infantry defensive.
		Adventurers:
			Female claimant adventurers can now target titles with *Cognatic* succession without being *Ambitious*.
			Male claimant adventurers need to be formidable in order to target titles with *Enatic-Cognatic* succession.
			Titles with female holders are only automatically targetable by adventurers if the title's succession laws disfavor women.
			Titles with male holders are now automatically targetable by adventurers if the title's succession laws disfavor men.
			Female adventurers following religions with *Enatic Clans* and male adventurers following an anti-feminist religion (i.e. with *Agnatic Clans* or one in the Muslim group that is not feminist) can now target titles regardless of their gender succession law.
		Claimant factions supporting males in realms with *Enatic* or *Enatic-Cognatic* succession will now be less likely to be created or supported by characters whose true religion has *Enatic Clans*, and those supporting females against males in those realms will be more likely to be created and/or supported by characters whose religion has *Enatic Clans*. This mirrors a similar dynamic less support for female claimants and more support for males against females by non-feminist characters in realms with *Agnatic* or *Agnatic-Cognatic* succession.
		Certain AI decision weight modifiers for following a pacifist religion (e.g. creating factions, supporting plots, accepting duels) will now only apply if the AI character's true religion is pacifist.
		AI decision weight modifiers that depend on the relation between their religion and that of a target character will now compare the true religion of the AI character to the type of religion of the target character about which the AI character knows (i.e. true religion if they have a secret religion that the AI character can see, public religion otherwise).
		Disabled health events related to *Giant*. These events are no longer appropriate now that *Giant* represents a height phenotype, not gigantism.
		Warrior Lodges:
			Being a member of a warrior lodge no longer gives as much protection from negative battlefield events.
			Increased the society currency cost of the *Call of the Steppes*, *Inspire Warriors*, and *Baltic Holds* decisions from 150 Renown to 300 Renown.
			*Inspire Warriors* can now only be used on Tribal holdings.
			Increased the society currency cost of *Stand Together* from 300 Renown to 500 Renown.
		Court Chaplains with a Secret Religion:
			Will never successfully convert provinces whose religion matches their true religion.
			Will never get attacked by heathens in provinces whose religion matches their true religion.
			When converting a character in the realm who does not have a secret religion to their public religion, will also set that character's secret religion to their true religion.
			If sent to a foreign leader to convert them, will not convert characters whose religion matches their true religion.
		Ask Courtiers to Leave Court:
			Will no longer select cousins, nieces, nephews, aunts, or uncles of the ruler.
			Will no longer select courtiers who owe favors to the ruler (because this makes them useful as potential future councillors and/or vassals for the ruler).
			Will no longer select Commanders or the Court Tutor.
			The check to make sure consorts, spouses, and parents of important characters are not selected will now be more thorough and properly identify consorts, spouses, and children who are important to the ruler.
			Can now select the parents of a child who is important to the current ruler if the child is an adult.
			Will no longer select the spouses or consorts of already selected courtiers, as they will move out with the selected courtiers anyway.
			If exiling a courtier with multiple spouses, will now exile all spouses with the courtier instead of just one.
			If exiling a courtier with consorts in the ruler's court, will now also exile all consorts with the courtier.
			If exiling a courtier with children in the ruler's court, will now only exile non-adult children with the courtier.
		Desert Fathers/Mothers:
			Are less likely to move to a different court/location if they are their liege's Court Physician.
			Will not move to a different court/location on their own if they are a nanny in charge of a child of Satan.
		*Organize a Raid*:
			If the event where the marshal's liege gets raiding troops has already fired once, it can now fire again once the marshal's liege does not own any troops gained from *Organize a Raid* instead of only 10 years after the last time it fired.
			Raiders gained from this action will now disband if the game detects that they have not been raiding for two months consecutively. Specifically, the game will now check every 30 days for whether or not the units are raiding, and the units disband if this check fails twice in a row. Previously, there was only one check (that did not work properly) that happened every 30 days, and if the units were not raiding when the check fired, they disbanded.
			Altered the amount of units gained from this action. If a character has a bloodline that attracts raiders, they will now get 12.50% of their total troops in raiders ranging 900-15000 (previously, they got 12.55% of their total troops ranging 1800-18000). If a character does not have a bloodline that attracts raiders, they will now get 10.00% of their total troops in raiders ranging 600-10500 (previously, they got 12.55% of their total troops ranging 1200-12000).
		The Event that Spawns Raiders for Tribal, Hungarian, Tengri AI Lords:
			Now uses the same martial score scale for its mean time to happen as *Organize a Raid* instead of its own, proprietary scaling.
			Is now affected by bloodlines that attract more raiders.
			Can now fire whenever the character does not have event-spawned, raiding troops instead of once every 10 years.
			Raiders gained from this event will now disband if the game detects that they have not been raiding for two months consecutively. Specifically, the game will now check every 30 days for whether or not the units are raiding, and the units disband if this check fails twice in a row. Previously, there was only one check (that did not work properly) that happened every 30 days, and if the units were not raiding when the check fired, they disbanded.
			Altered the amount of units gained from this event. If a character has a bloodline that attracts raiders, they will now get 25.00% of their total troops in raiders ranging 900-15000. If a character does not have a bloodline that attracts raiders, they will now get 20.00% of their total troops in raiders ranging 600-10500. Previously, this event gave 144.14% of total troops in raiders ranging 400-12000.
		*Build Zeal* Event Troops:
			Their spawning event can fire whenever the character does not already have troops spawned by *Build Zeal* instead of once every 10 years.
			Will no longer remain until their ruler's death if their ruler is in a religious war exactly one year from their spawn. Instead, the game will check every month if their ruler is in a religious war, and they will disband if the ruler is not in a religious war for 12 consecutive months.
			Altered the number of units spawned. Rulers will now get 25.00% of their total troops in zealots ranging 600-10500. Previously, this event gave 24.22% of total troops ranging 300-9000.
		*Build Legend*:
			Event troops' spawning event can fire whenever the character does not already have troops spawned by *Build Legend* instead of once every 10 years.
			Event troops will no longer remain until their ruler's death if their ruler is in a war roughly one year from their spawn. Instead, the game will check every month if their ruler is in a war, and they will disband if the ruler is not in a war for 12 consecutive months.
			Altered the number of units spawned. Rulers will now get 25.00% of their total troops in units ranging 600-10500. Previously, this event gave 24.22% of total troops ranging 300-9000.
			Event troops can now spawn for the AI even if they are not in a war.
			The prestige reduction when the event troops disband from not being at war for 12 consecutive months will now only happen to human players since the AI does not know it needs to go to war to keep the troops from disbanding.
		Councillors with a primary stat of 7, 5, 3, or 1 will now perform slightly better than if they had a primary stat of 6, 4, 2, or 0 respectively.
		Children and incapable characters can now use the *Come Out of Hiding* decision, though prisoners now cannot.
		Events and decisions that cause a ruler or a province to convert to a heresy will now apply moral authority modifiers as if they had converted religions.
		Feudal rulers who can adopt *Eldership* succession at the start of the game will now also start with *Eldership* succession. Previously, this was restricted to Tribal rulers only, despite *Eldership* succession being available for Feudal rulers as well.
		The limitations on the *Replace Regent* plot for female characters under a liege with *Agnatic* or *Agnatic-Cognatic* succession are now mirrored for male characters under a liege with *Enatic* or *Enatic-Cognatic* succession.
		Characters can no longer get *Stressed* or *Depressed* from Rulership focus. Other focuses do not give negative traits, and Rulership is not really powerful enough to justify having them.
		Owning a *Finger of St. John* will no longer increase the speed at which court chaplains convert provinces. This makes the artifact consistent in its effects with *Saint's Fingerbone*.
		AI Counts will no longer take twice as long as normal to convert a province's religion.
		Israelite and Mazdan religions no longer have access to Great Holy Wars from the start of the game. Instead, Great Holy Wars for them will be unlocked roughly within 10 years of Crusades and/or Jihads being unlocked for Christian and Muslim religions, the same way it works for pagans.
		EMF's weak claim pre-inheritance upon adulthood of male characters' mother's strong claims to titles under *Agnatic* or *Agnatic-Cognatic* succession as well as the reverse version for female pre-inheritance under *Enatic* or *Enatic-Cognatic* succession are now, in addition to happening throughout the game, retroactively applied upon campaign initialization.
		The event where a meteorite falls can now only trigger for patricians and landed characters who are Count-tier or higher instead of for all characters.
		Great Works:
			The Eternal Flame great work upgrade now also gives +5 opinion from characters following a religion in the Mazdan group.
			Added a new great work called Great Jain Temple. It is a religious great work mirroring Great Cathedral, Great Mosque, Great Temple, Great Hindu Temple, and Great Buddhist Temple, but for Jains. It has passive effects and great work upgrades very similar to a Great Hindu Temple, but has access to a new upgrade, Manastambha, instead of the Great Hindu Temple upgrade Gopuram.
			Added a new great work called Great Fire Temple. It is a religious great work mirroring Great Cathedral, Great Mosque, Great Temple, Great Hindu Temple, and Great Buddhist Temple, but for the Mazdan religious group. It has a variety of buildable unique great work upgrades, but is most similar to the Great Temple great work.
		AI characters are now willing to use *Write a Book* even if they already have a book, though not if they have four or more books (since characters are limited to having four books equipped at a time).
		Diseases:
			If playing with Reaper's Due, Tuberculosis, Typhoid Fever, and Syphilis outbreaks' base duration is now 36 months (from 30).
			If playing with Reaper's Due, Bubonic Plague outbreaks' base duration is now 48 months (from 36 in Vanilla Map, 50 in SWMH). The duration for absolutely deadly outbreaks is now 48 months (from 50).
		The event where a bankrupt, Catholic ruler seizes church property can now also trigger for Fraticelli rulers.
		AI Rulers Leading Their Own Troops:
			Theocracy religious heads who do not have martial education will no longer lead their own troops. This restriction previously only applied to the Catholic Pope.
			AI count- and baron-tier rulers can now lead their own troops.
			Pregnant AI characters who do not have *Lunatic* will now no longer lead their own troops.
		Pious/Impious Traits:
			*Chaste*, *Humble*, and *Content* no longer count as pious traits on their own.
			*On Pilgrimage* (Dharmic variant), *Pilgrim* (Dharmic variant), *Yazidi Pilgrim*, *Beatified*, and *Blessed Ancestor* now count as pious traits.
			*Haemophiliac*, *Haemophant*, and *Haemoarch* now count as pious traits for religions with ritual sacrifice.
			Characters who have no pious traits but also have no impious traits are now also eligible for beatification.
			*Impaler* now only counts as an impious trait for religions without ritual sacrifice.
			*Lustful* no longer counts as an impious trait on its own.
			*Homosexual* now counts as an impious trait for Abrahamic religions, religions with *Christian Syncretism*, and religions with *Muslim Syncretism*.
		Characters with any *Bastard* or *Legitimized Bastard* children are no longer counted as pious and can now be counted as impious (if they have no pious traits).
		The Andalusian and Berber Taifa states in Spain between the 1010s and 1230s will now start with their *Focus* laws shifted to maximum tax instead of maximum levy.
		The option to demand the transfer of a vassal from a kidnapped victim now has slightly different triggers:
			It can now work if the victim is in the same realm as the kidnapper, instead of requiring that the kidnapper be non-independent and have the same direct liege as the victim.
			The randomly selected vassal to transfer must be one who is not a direct de jure vassal of the victim.
			Vassals who are in revolts can no longer be selected as the random vassal to transfer.
			Baron-tier vassals can now also be selected. However, the game will now try to maximize the tier of the randomly selected vassal, so eligible baron vassals will only be selected if there are no count- or higher-tier eligible vassals.
		Feudal rulers who are Pagans, Israelites, or non-Catholic Western Christians will now be just as likely to start with Council power laws set towards Council options as Catholic feudal rulers.
		Cultural Retinues, Combat Tactics, and Castle/Tribal Buildings:
			[Vanilla Map] Berbers now get the cultural retinues, cultural combat tactics, and cultural castle/tribal buildings that SWMH Berbers get instead of those that Arabs get.
			[SWMH] Siqilli, Hijazi, Yamani, and Maghribi characters now get the cultural retinues, cultural combat tactics, and cultural castle/tribal buildings that North Africans get instead of those that other Arabs get.
			Al-Faris retinues are now composed of 100 Heavy Cavalry + 150 Camel Cavalry (from 250 Camel Cavalry) and now also give +60% Heavy Cavalry Offensive.
			Renamed the cultural retinues for North Africans to "Desert Cavalry". Desert Cavalry retinues now get +60% Camel Cavarly Offensive (from +30%) and +60% Light Cavalry Offensive (from +30%) to bring them in line with other cultural retinues.
			Renamed the cultural castle/tribal building line for North Africans to "Desert Cavalry Training Ground". Fixed an issue where levels 2-6 of this building line could not be manually built.
			Renamed the cultural castle/tribal building line for Arabs to "Al-Faris Training Ground". It now gives a mix of Camel Cavalry and Heavy Cavalry (from pure Camel Cavalry) and gives bonuses to Heavy Cavalry Offensive instead of Camel Cavalry Defensive.
			Bedouins now get their own cultural retinues and cultural castle/tribal buildings that are different from the default Arab ones.
				The Bedouin cultural retinues are called "Tali'a". They are composed of 250 Camel Cavalry and give +60% Camel Cavalry Offensive.
				The Bedouin cultural castle/tribal building line is called "Camel Riding Ground". They give Camel Cavalry levies and increase Camel Cavalry Offensive and Defensive.

			Zãbãnnya retinues now also give +60% Light Infantry Offensive.
			Soturi Lempo retinues now also give +30% Pikemen Offensive and +30% Pikemen Defensive.

				Pashto and Kufichi cultural retinues are called "Da Gra Jungyaly". They are composed of 190 Light Infantry and 60 Archers and give +60% Light Infantry Defensive and +60% Archer Defensive.
				Daylamite, Pashto, and Kufichi commanders get access to a new cultural combat tactic type called "Attriting Raid" instead of the default Iranian "Retreat and Ambush" tactic type. Attriting Raid is an upgraded version of (Melee) Raid that gives an extra +50% Light Infantry Defensive on top of the usual bonuses from Raid tactics.
				The Daylamite cultural castle/tribal building line is called "Daylamite Infantry Barracks". It focuses on lots of Light Infantry and a modest amount of Pikemen, and it gives bonuses to Light Infantry Defensive and Pikemen Defensive.
				The Pashto and Kufichi cultural castle/tribal building line is called "Highland Militia Quarters". It focuses on lots of Light Infantry and a modest amount of Archers, and it gives bonuses to Light Infantry Defensive and Pikemen Defensive.
				Holdings in Daylamite, Pashto, and Kufichi provinces with Steppe terrain now use the normal building lines for Barracks and Stables instead of the special, Steppe-specific lines that are available for certain cultures.
		Technology:
			The reduction in the chances of getting a bad tactic based on the levels of a character's *Melee Techniques* or *Skirmish Techniques* technology now increases at every tech level instead of only increasing at levels 2, 4, 6, and 8.
			*Infantry* no longer increases Light Infantry Morale, Archer Morale, Pikemen Morale, and Heavy Infantry Morale.
			*Cavalry* no longer increases Light Cavalry Morale, Heavy Cavalry Morale, Horse Archer Morale, Camel Cavalry Morale, and War Elephant Morale. Instead, it now also gives +6% Light Cavalry Offensive, +6% Heavy Cavalry Offensive, +6% Horse Archer Offensive, +6% Camel Cavalry Offensive, and +6% War Elephant Offensive per level.
			*Skirmish Techniques* no longer increases Light Cavalry Offensive, Horse Archer Offensive, Archer Offensive, and Camel Cavalry Offensive. Instead, it now also gives +5% Light Cavalry Morale, +5% Horse Archer Morale, +5% Archer Morale, +5% Light Infantry Morale, and +5% Camel Cavalry Morale per level.
			*Melee Techniques* no longer increases Heavy Cavalry Offensive, Pikemen Offensive, and Heavy Infantry Offensive. Instead, it now also gives +5% Heavy Cavalry Morale, +5% Pikemen Morale, +5% Heavy Infantry Morale, and +5% War Elephant Morale per level.
		(Skirmish) Charge Combat Tactics:
			The combat tactics that cause a flank to charge and change the flank's combat phase from skirmish to melee have now been renamed to "Closing Charge" to avoid confusion with charge tactics that occur in the melee phase.
			Devastating Closing Charge, Failed Closing Charge, and Charge on Undefended Flank now also modify Defensive for all troops, just like other Devastating and Failed variants of combat tactics.
			Fixed the Offensive modifiers on Failed Closing Charge so that it now follows the pattern of other Failed variants of combat tactics.
			Closing Charge tactics now also boost War Elephant Offensive by +100%/+75%/+50% for Devastating/Normal/Failed variants respectively.
			Added Glorious Closing Charge for when a flank charges with a commander who has used *Call to Glory*. It provides an extra +50% Offensive and Defensive to all troop types on top of the normal modifiers for Closing Charge, similar to other Glorious combat tactics.
			Charge on Undefended Flank now provides an extra +50% Offensive and Defensive to all troop types instead of +25%.
		Mercenary and Holy Order Compositions:

			Persian Caravan Guards now use a composition that is 60% Light Cavalry and 40% Horse Archers (from 60% Light Cavalry and 40% Camel Cavalry).
			Mercenaries and Holy Orders that have Galleys will now have enough to transport all of their troops at the start of the game.
		Historical Bloodlines:
			Historical bloodlines that were added with Holy Fury now have activation triggers similar to those added in the Iron Century Patch (culture- and religion-based).

		The Fraticelli pope can no longer get the event that turns *Chaste* into *Celibate*, just like the Catholic pope.
		Suspected witches (from the Rulership focus event) will now have the religion and culture of the province where they are from instead of the religion and culture of the ruler being asked to do something about them.

		The Toluid dynasty is no longer assigned to randomly generated characters.
		The great works Hindu Temple and Temple have been renamed to Great Hindu Temple and Great Buddhist Temple respectively.
		When looking for a courtier to assist with seduction of a target, characters who are married to the target or who are rivals with the character can no longer be selected.

		The Solomonid bloodline now confers opinion bonus from Miaphysite characters only.
		The Ghaznavid bloodline now confers opinion bonus from Persian characters instead of Afghan characters.
		The Muhammad Nasrid bloodline now confers opinion bonus from Andalusian Arabic characters only.

		When reforming a pagan religion without Holy Fury enabled, unit modifiers from the unreformed version of the religion are no longer lost upon reformation.
		Properly removed synergy requirements for Meliorism to improve education traits.
		Certain pieces of code that checked for gender equality will now properly detect unreformed Bön in games without Holy Fury enabled.
		When deciding whether to join or create an Independence or claimant faction, AI characters will now properly be more inclined to do so if they consider their liege as hostile to their religion.

		Yesügei and Hoelun (Temujin's parents) will now spawn with the correct religion and culture.
		If *Nomad Stability* is set to *Unstable*, the event that lets vassals become independent now also triggers upon succession of a non-independent, vassal khan, not just upon succession of the main, khagan title.

		Fraticelli characters can now take the Become a Crusader objective if the Fraticelli pope has called a crusade.
		The *Restore Order to the Court* decision can now properly be taken to remove *Court Anarchy*.
		*Organize a Raid*:
			If the game recognizes that troops gained from this action are raiding (this check is actually a bit buggy) 122 days after the spawning event fired, troops gained from this event will no longer stay until their ruler dies. They will instead continue to check regularly whether or not they are raiding.
			The bloodline effect where more raiders are attracted by this action now works properly.
		Fixed numerous cases where a ruler or a province converting religions would not be accompanied by moral authority modifiers.
		Theocracies and nomadic realms can no longer end up with *Seniority* succession.

		Fixed issues where historical artifacts could spawn in the courtiers of the historical owners of said artifacts.
		When successfully kidnapping a ruler with a county or barony on which the kidnapper has a claim, that is in the kidnapper's de jure territory, or is in the de jure territory of a title on which the kidnapper has a claim, the kidnapper can now properly request transfer of the title even if they are independent and/or the victim is not under the same liege as them.
		The current heir under *Dynastic Elective* and *Eldership* succession will no longer be labeled as a Tanist.
		The Caesar minor title cannot be granted to rulers whose primary title is temporary, making it in line with all other minor titles.

		[Vanilla Map] Fixed the baronies of the province Alcacer do Sal.
		Fixed rulers with *Enatic Clans* being able to employ male councillors.
		Unlanded women can no longer become advisors for any ruler who does not follow *Agnatic Clans*.
		The *Declare <Religion> Emancipation* decision will no longer count heretic courtiers in the courts of theocracies as heretic bishops.
		The decisions to secretly convert to a religion whose holy site a character owns is now also available if the only rulers of the target religion are independent.

		The *Call of the Steppes* decision's tooltip about a 10-year cooldown is now only visible for non-nomadic characters who are affected by it.

		When a warrior lodge assigns a coastal target for the mission to raid and loot a province, it will now take naval path distance into account in addition to raw distance.
		Characters whose public religion is in the same religious group as a given character's secret religion can no longer be the target of Evoke Sympathy missions.
		Characters who develop Chest Pains without an associated illness can now properly get symptom treatment for it.
		Reformation Doctrines that Affect Succession Laws:
			Fixed the tooltips for *Agnatic Clans* and *Enatic Clans* to properly display their succession law effects.
			Winning a war with the *Patriarchal Deposition* or *Matriarchal Deposition* CB will now only change the target title's gender succession laws if they do not already favor the attacker's religion's gender preferences and will only change to a succession law that is allowed by the target title holder. If succession laws are changed through this CB, opinion modifiers are also applied as if the succession law was changed regularly.
			Winning a war with the *Patriarchal Deposition* CB against an enemy with *Enatic Clans* or a *Matriarchal Deposition* CB against an enemy with *Agnatic Clans* will now properly change their gender succession laws to *Enatic-Cognatic* and *Agnatic-Cognatic* respectively.
			Upon conversion to or reformation of a religion with *Agnatic Clans*, *Enatic Clans*, *Equality*, or *Harmonious*, gender succession laws are only changed if the current one(s) are disallowed by the new doctrine, and opinion modifiers for changing gender succession are only applied if succession laws are actually changed.
			Opinion modifiers for changing gender succession laws are now also applied to unreformed pagan characters whose gender succession laws are changed after reformation of a religion with *Agnatic Clans*, *Enatic Clans*, *Equality*, or *Harmonious*.
			Opinion modifiers for changing gender succession laws due to conversion to *Agnatic Clans*, *Enatic Clans*, *Equality*, or *Harmonious* now mirror the opinion modifiers that would be gained by changing gender succession laws normally instead of them being a special modifier that is applied selectively.
			*Open* succession is no longer automatically applied upon reformation of or conversion to a religion with *Agnatic Clans* or *Enatic Clans*, as being locked into *Open* succession is not a stated feature of those doctrines. This also resolves anti-synergy between those doctrines and doctrines that unlock *Eldership* succession (so e.g. West African pagans with *Eldership* succession will not switch off of their special succession type if they pick *Agnatic Clans* or *Enatic Clans*).
			AI rulers of (unplayable) republics will switch their gender succession laws upon conversion to a religion with *Agnatic Clans*, *Enatic Clans*, *Equality*, or *Harmonious*.
			*Equality* and *Enatic Clans* can now be properly chosen as doctrines by reformers who are patricians, though they will not affect their gender succession laws.
			When a new holder of a title follows a religion with *Agnatic Clans*, *Enatic Clans*, *Equality*, or *Harmonious* and the old holder of the title did not have the same gender law restrictions, the title's laws are now properly updated.
			*Meritocracy* is no longer incompatible with *Agnatic Clans* or *Enatic Clans*.
		Events where China interacts with and possibly sends characters to others will no longer trigger for mercenaries, holy orders, and unlanded rulers.
		The China Grace decisions *Send Gift*, *Offer Eunuch*, *Offer Concubine*, *Offer Commander*, *Offer Physician*, *Send Relief*, *Offer Artifact*, *Get a Chinese Doctor*, *Get a Chinese Artifact*, *Get Chinese Siege Engineers*, *Get Chinese Strategist*, *Request Administrator*, *Request Master Engineer*, *Imperial Marriage*, and *Request Invasion* can now be taken by unlanded Patricians.
		Corrected the AI chances for both re-attempting induction of a ward into a secret religious society and rejecting the re-attempt at induction so that they are properly based off of relations, traits, and stats instead of basically being 50/50.
		The battle event where a character's shieldmaiden saves them but is injured in the process will now only happen if the shieldmaiden in question is in the same location as their liege.
		Hermatic Society:
			AI members of the Hermetic society will now write Magnum Opi.
			AI members of the Hermetic society will no longer have a 50% chance of going back on their decision to build a laboratory and can now get the quest to build a laboratory at all ranks, just like human members.
			When a courtier in the Hermetic society dies, their host no longer loses their Hermetic apprentice.
		When swapping a councillor who is on a search for a relic, progress on their search is no longer reset.
		West African pagans' unit modifiers are now in line with those of other defensive pagans.
		The event option where a character decides to go on a hunt with someone who they are swaying will now work properly if the character does not have *Hunter*.
		Nomadic Uprisings:
			Event troops from minor clan uprisings will now all disband when the uprising is over.
			The main event troops from minor clan uprisings will no longer disband if the leader of the uprising dies.
			Peasant revolts can now spawn in nomadic provinces with empty holdings if the owner of the given province does not risk a minor clan uprising.
			Leaders of minor clan uprisings can now be female if they are of the appropriate religion and can no longer be male if following a religion with *Enatic Clans*.
		Reformed pagan rulers will now properly get piety from pagan festivals.
		Prisoners are no longer eligible for dueling.
		Court chaplains sent to convert foreign rulers will no longer convert reformed pagan courtiers residing in the courts of unreformed pagans.
		Grandmasters of the Assassins will no longer give missions to assassinate themselves. As a side effect, if a character is the only Grandmaster in the Assassins, they are immune to assassinate missions.
		Traits and modifiers that would be removed upon changing religion can no longer be acquired for inappropriate religions by switching religions after an event has fired but before choosing an event option that would grant such a trait/modifier. Events with only one option will now immediately apply the trait/modifier upon firing instead of when the option is selected, while events with multiple options will check for a character's religion before applying a trait/modifier from the selected option.
		Switching religions within the Mazdan group will no longer remove characters' holy pets.
		All Hindu, Khurmazta, and Bön patron deities now have an equal chance of being chosen by the AI.
		AI West African pagan characters no longer have an artificially inflated chance of picking Ayyur, Bida, or Tsumburbura as their patron deities.
		The event that rewards close-kin marriages under religions that encourage them will now properly only trigger on the character's first marriage, just like the regular marriage reward event.
		The *Come Out of Hiding* decision can now be taken by unlanded characters who do not have a ruler spouse or ruler parent who could take them out of hiding. There would otherwise be no way for these characters to remove their *In Hiding* state.
		Cyprus and Crete After a Victorious Crusade Against the Byzantine Empire:
			Provinces in Cyprus and Crete that are not in the Byzantine Empire will not be taken by crusade participants.
			Provinces in Cyprus under the Byzantine Empire will now be taken by crusaders even if the owners of those provinces have a religion different from the Byzantine emperor.
			If a player owns some but not all of the provinces in Cyprus and/or Crete, the provinces not owned by them can still be taken by crusaders.
			The patrician who will be taking provinces in Crete after the crusade will not get the Duchy of Crete if they will not own the majority of the provinces in Crete.
			The crusade beneficiary who will be taking provinces in Cyprus after the crusade will not get the Duchy of Cyprus or the Kingdom of Cyprus if they will not own the majority of provinces in Cyprus.
		Rulers publicly converting to their (previously) secret religion will now properly apply moral authority modifiers to both their original religion and their new one.
		Public conversions of rulers and provinces caused by a secret religious society using *Openly Adopt Faith* will now properly apply moral authority modifiers for converting rulers and converting provinces respectively.
		Non-Christian, *Zealot* councillors no longer care about deposing wicked popes.
		Characters with a bloodline that enables *Enatic-Cognatic* succession will not unlock the succession law if following a religion with *Agnatic Clans*, *Equality*, or *Harmonious*.
		If *Gender Equality* is set to *Full*, characters following religions with *Agnatic Clans* or *Enatic Clans* will now get proper access to *Cognatic* succession law.
		In Random Worlds with randomized religion names, the tooltips for the requirements for joining warrior lodge societies will now properly display the religion names that were generated for the world.
		The game will now properly recognize historical and/or important characters that should not be allowed to leave a ruler's court.
		Incitatus will no longer challenge immortal characters if *Silly Events* is set to *Off*.
		Characters can now disband their nomadic mercenary companies even if they would not be able to re-found one.
		Numerous special bloodline effects will now properly only take effect if the bloodline to which they are attached is active for the owner of the bloodline.
		Saintly bloodlines that attract Jews are no longer only active on Christian characters. Instead, they now have the same requirements as other saintly bloodlines: characters need to follow the same religion as the bloodline founder for it to be active.
		AI characters who are true believers in their religion will now properly never request mass baptisms.
		Unreformed pagan characters who are converted by foreign court chaplains will no longer receive a mass baptism if they have a regent, tbey are tribal and their primary title has too low Tribal Organization, or the court chaplain's liege is a prisoner or has a regent, as these would all disqualify them from requesting a mass baptism.
		The event where an army starts looting out of control after a successful siege will no longer trigger if the army in question is raiding instead of in an actual war.
		The event chain where an annoying courtier gets pushed into a river no longer has broken localizations.
		Passive Infidel Province Conversion for Muslims:
			Will now only trigger if the top liege of the owner of the province is imposing Jizya or a religious tax on the province's capital holding instead of if the province is not Muslim and both the province owner and their top liege are Muslim.
			Province will now convert to the religion of its owner's top liege instead of the religion of its owner.
			Mean time to happen for the event is properly modified by the moral authority of the religion to which the province would be converted instead of the current religion of the province.
			Mean time to happen modifiers that apply to the event for active conversion by court chaplain will now also apply to this event. This includes bloodline effects, Great Works upgrade effects, religious features, depopulation levels, holy war integration policies, and more.
		Saintly bloodlines that increase the speed of religious conversion will now work properly.
		Having the active bloodline *Blood of Irâcêntira 'the Great'* will now properly cause the ruler's court chaplain to convert provinces to Hindu faster. Previously, the effect of converting provinces to Hindu faster required the bloodline to be on and active for the ruler's court chaplain, not the ruler themselves.
		Characters spying on their lovers can no longer "reveal" their own relationship and attempt to blackmail themselves.
		The event where a character gains Diplomacy from practicing in front of a mirror can now only trigger once.
		Great Works:
			The great work upgrades Temple Complex, Votive Stupa, Outer Wall and Open Garden, and Sahn now properly require a certain amount of existing great work upgrades before they can be built.
			When built, the Strategic Exclaves great work upgrade will now properly upgrade the fortifications of all holdings in the province of the great work in which it was built.
			Fixed numerous decisions and events that check for great works and/or great work upgrades so that they will only work if the great works and/or great work upgrades they check for are actually active.
			The House of Wisdom now also upgrades written books, just like the base Great Library does.
			When a Great Library is raided, it now properly gives books to the raider, not bells.
			The House of Wisdom will now properly be referred to as a library, not a university.
		Artifacts:
			+2 Axe, Spear of Destiny, Staff of Moses, David's Sling, Handgun, and Plate Armor are no longer active for children, just like all other, non-ceremonial weapon and armor artifacts.
			+2 Axe is now properly flagged as being an axe.
			Plate Armor is now properly flagged as being an armor set.
			Jian is now properly flagged as being a combat weapon.
			Sword from Heaven and random swords generated during alternate starts are now properly flagged as swords and combat weapons.
			Random armor generated during alternate starts are now properly flagged as armor and armor sets.
			Books generated from the event chain where a lost book is found for a Grand Library are now properly flagged as books.
		[Vanilla Map] King Ramiro II of León (at the Iron Century start date) will no longer be married to both Adosinda de Coimbra and Urraka Jimena. He will now be only married to Urraka Jimena.
		The event where crusaders massacre the local population because of their religion will no longer trigger if the province follows the same religion as the crusaders.
		The Total Burnout option to the Meliorism failure event chain outcome (the option that downgrades the character's education) now properly only appears and can only be taken if no other option is available. It is supposed to be Total Burnout, after all.
		The gender criteria to be eligible for the Patrician Heir minor title are now based purely on succession laws instead of Status of Women laws and/or religion.
		Fixed the detection of gender succession laws when selecting a random crusade beneficiary for AI characters.
		Hermetic characters who get the best outcome once from the Gathering of the Great Minds event chain will no longer always get the best outcome in all future instances of the Gathering of the Great Minds event chain.
		The event chain where a monastery has an artifact that can be stolen will no longer trigger for characters who already have every artifact that could be received from the event chain.
		[Vanilla Map] The Viking Age Begins event will now properly add shipyard buildings to holdings based on holding types instead of based on the owners of the holdings. They will now also properly add shipyard buildings to primary holdings of provinces, not just secondary holdings.
		*Renounce Iconoclasm* now also applies a negative opinion modifier for independent Muslim rulers, not just Muslim characters who are not independent.
		In the homage event chain, the detection of rulers with titles whose gender succession laws disfavor them will now work properly.
		Vassals will now properly detect when they are attracted to their liege during the homage event chain.
		The decision to convert to Buddhism will now also be disabled for Holy Orders.
		[Vanilla Map] Lucia Sorrenti will now properly be female.
		Devil Worshipers desecrating a temple that they hold can no longer kill themselves through the event chain and will no longer reveal themselves as Devil Worshipers through the event chain.
	*MODDING:*
		The effect emf_character_become_heretic now no longer sets the heretic_province event target if it has already been set (outside the effect). This means submods can now use this effect to make a character a heretic based on a province other than the one in which they currently are.
		Changed the conditions of many decisions and events that work off of great work upgrades so that they check for flags on great work upgrades rather than specific great work upgrades. This means new great work upgrades can be added that imitate the effects of existing great work upgrades without having to create new decisions and/or events.
		The customizable localization of types, flavor texts, and terrain descriptions of wonders and great work upgrades now works off of flags instead of checking for specific wonders. This means that new wonders and great work upgrades can make use of existing localization as long as they have the appropriate flags, which means updating of customizable localization is no longer required.
		Great Library and Grand University can now be built by characters whose religious group is not one of the six religious groups that exist in the base game.
		Added a set of dummy characters generated at startup in Isis' court, each of whom corresponds to a religion available in the game. They are saved as global event targets with the naming scheme "emf_global_<religion>_dummy". They are intended to be used for triggers that work off of character/province religions, but that do not actually work in religion scopes, e.g. is_heretic, is_heresy_of, and is_parent_religion.
			Also added a set of scripted triggers that work off of these dummy characters to check if the current scope's true religion would pass certain is_heretic, is_heresy_of, and is_parent_religion checks. They can be found in emf_religion_codegen_triggers.


EMF 10.2 [2019-09-06]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		Added a new succession law, *Dynastic Elective Succession*.
			It is almost identical to *Elective Monarchy Succession*, but the eligible candidates are now all members of the ruler's dynasty. The law requires *High Crown Authority* or higher, *Late Feudal Administration*, or *Imperial Administration*.
		The *Decline Empire Election* decision is now obsoleted by a new pair of decisions, *Decline Elective Nomination* and *Approve Elective Nomination*, which appear whenever you've received at least one vote and are now in the line of succession for an elective title of King- or Empire-tier.
			The latter decision, approval, essentially only dismisses both alerts since approval is status quo.
			The new decisions support all types of elective succession laws, and they are integrated into their voting rules, so you will now also properly no longer appear heir to the title after declining a nomination (no more last-minute hack to disinherit you momentarily when the incumbent ruler is dying).
			The new decisions let you choose to approve or deny votes for your character for multiple different titles independently.
			As always, your decisions are lifetime-binding, so choose them wisely. You don't have to choose immediately (or ever) upon getting such a pair of alerts.
		AI:
			Increased the difficulty of players rapidly securing the inheritance of AI titles with *Agnatic-Cognatic Succession* by teaching the AI when it's not a good idea to pass *Agnatic-Cognatic* and when it is a good idea to promptly pass *Agnatic*.
			Many AI spymasters will now be more likely to be loyal to their liege and thus won't be as easily manipulated into plotting against them.
			AI rulers can no longer dump gold into new building or holding constructions while at war.
		Patricians can now offer to buy a new city holding from the owner of a province in which they have a trade post but no owned holding, assuming the province has an empty holding in which the new city can be built.
			Use the *Expand Trade Post into City* trade post decision, and a new city will be constructed.
			The cost scales with the amount of existing holdings in the province, ranging from 400 gold to 900 gold, of which 300 gold is transfered to the top liege of the owner of the province.
			Enacting this decision will create a 5-year mutual truce between the patrician and the province owner.
			You cannot be bankrupt or at war with the province owner nor any liege of the province owner.
		Elector titles under *Princely Elective Succession* (i.e., the Holy Roman Empire or Saint-Empire Romain) are now dynamically reassigned when they become unheld, gained by another preexisting Prince-Elector, or become no longer a de jure part of the Empire. Assignment preferences are based upon a healthy mix of historical and gameplay factors.
			When restoring either of the two HRE title variants from pre-962 starts, elector titles will now also be dynamically assigned (just as they are every time a campaign is started).
		New government type: *Muslim Merchant Republic:*
			This government is analogous to the *Merchant Republic* government type the same way *Iqta* relates to *Feudal*: it has all the features of *Merchant Republic*, but also has free revocation on duchy-tier titles, requires Piety expenditures to change laws, allows holding of Temple holdings without penalty, and does not get opinion penalties for raising levies for offensive wars.
	*CHANGES:*
		English melting pot now also includes the Duchy of Lothian.
		Stillborn birth chance has been raised to 7% from 3%.
		Banishing unlanded characters will now seize 20% of their total wealth instead of 5%.
		*Plot to Gain Vassal Title*, and those plots of its ilk, now require AI plotters to be at peace before activating the plot.
		Changed the way genders are randomized for peasant revolts. Instead of there being a 50% chance of a spawned peasant leader being female, the chance now depends on the province's top liege's gender succession laws:
			The chances are <1% for *Agnatic*, 10% for *Agnatic-Cognatic*, 50% for *Absolute Cognatic*, 90% for *Enatic-Cognatic*, and >99% for *Enatic*.
		Elective-type succession laws:
			Elective succession law voting is now more reasonable about electing "foreign" rulers (i.e., their capital is not a de jure part of the elective title) when said ruler-candidate will automatically take over the de jure capital of the elective title holder upon succession.
			*Princely Elective* no longer requires its electors to always have the same religion as the emperor. This stops some very silly behavior when the emperor changes religion or even just when, e.g., a Prince-Elector adopts a different religion.
			*Elective Monarchy* is no longer allowed for Muslims, although Indians may still use it (as they cannot in vanilla).
			All elective succession laws will now score members of a cadet dynasty or their parent dynasty as highly as they used to score members of their own dynasty. The same-dynasty scoring bonus has been doubled.
			*Deaf*, *Dim*, and *Delicate* now also affect voting scores for all elective-style succession laws instead of just *Elective Monarchy*.
			Cousins, uncles, aunts, nephews, and nieces of the ruler are now eligible as candidates for *Elective Monarchy*, *Dynastic Elective*, *Princely Elective*, and *Imperial Elective* succession types.
		Trade posts:
			Trade Practices now give -87.5%/-75%/-62.5%/-50%/-37.5%/-25%/-12.5%/+0% maximum trade posts (from -66.7%/-33.3%/0%/+10%/+20%/+30%/+40%/+50%). Due to other sources of trade post limit increases being modified, the practical effects of this change are that male dynasty members in patrician courts give a lower bonus to trade post count than before (overall effect compared to before is -62.5%/-62.5%/-62.5%/-54.5%/-47.9%/-42.3%/-37.5%/-33.3%).
			Base max trade posts has been increased to 2 from 1 to compensate for Trade Practices changes.
			Minimum trade posts has been increased to 7 from 4 to compensate for Trade Practices changes.
			The palace line in Family Palace holdings now gives +2/+6/+12/+20 trade posts (from +0/+3/+6/+9) to compensate for Trade Practices changes.
			Changed the [top liege of trade post province] opinion cost modifier for building foreign trade posts to -50% at 100 opinion and +50% at -100 opinion (from -40% and +40% respectively).
		Patricians:
			Muslim merchant republics can now [finally] again work correctly due to changes in our succession law code. They were previously disabled due to issues with past CKII patches (since a bug in CKII 2.4 / Horse Lords). Like non-Muslims, their family palaces use *Seniority Succession* and of course the top-tier merchant republic title uses *Patrician Elective Succession*.
			The *Convert to Merchant Republic* day-1 targeted decision (only available before unpausing the game at campaign start!), which can be enacted on adult feudal or tribal rulers with coastal capitals, can now [finally again] target Muslims as well in order to convert them to a [duke-tier] merchant republic.
			The income split between patricians and their male dynasty members in court has been adjusted from 50:5/member to 80:2/member. This is to compensate for trade post changes.
			Unlanded patricians can now take the *Make a Friend* and *Create a Treasury* ambitions.
			Unlanded patricians with appropriate bloodlines can take the *Drill Troops* and *Endear Realm* decisions.
		Changed the tiered bonuses for demesne holdings in a ruler's capital county, de jure capital duchy, de jure capital kingdom, and other (de jure capital empire and beyond).
			Notably, there are ONLY bonuses now; there shall be no "Outside Capital Region" types of maluses any longer. Further, modifiers for holdings within your de jure capital kingdom are no longer neutral and now give a [modest] bonus too.
		Governments:
			*Iqta* and *al-Mulk* governments no longer feature free vassal retraction.
			A number of government types in which Barons didn't receive a dynasty automatically (i.e., they were lowborn) now do give new dynasties to Barons automatically.
			A new government type has been added: *Monastic Imperial*.
				It is the imperial version of the *Monastic Feudal* government, complete with free title revocation on duke- and king-tier titles. As a result of this addition, *Monastic Feudal* governments that adopt *Imperial Administration* will no longer switch to *Imperial* government, which among other things, removed their ability to hold Temple holdings without penalty.
			*Chinese Imperial*:
				The decision to adopt *Chinese Imperial* government no longer requires a realm size of 200, but instead requires *Imperial Administration*. Switching off of *Imperial Administration* will also revert away from the *Chinese Imperial* government type.
				The decision to adopt *Chinese Imperial* government will no longer pass *Primogeniture* succession.
				*Elective Gavelkind*, *Feudal Elective*, *Imperial Elective*, *Princely Elective*, *Eldership*, and *Tanistry* succession laws are now available to *Chinese Imperial* governments.
				*Chinese Imperial* government is now classified as an Imperial government type, meaning it gets all the same events and event modifications that governments like *Imperial*, *al-Mulk*, *Patareni Imperial*, and *Monastic Imperial* get, and vassals without viceroy exemptions will adopt Imperial government types.
				*Chinese Imperial* governments now get free title revocation on king-tier titles.
		Laws:
			Characters following religions with the *Cosmopolitan* feature now need the *Title Revocation Allowed* law in order to pass *Imperial Administration*. Previously, they could pass *Imperial Administration* with *No Title Revocation*.
			Zhangzhung and Sumpa characters now default to *Absolute Cognatic* succession. Basque characters who are duke-, count-, or baron-tier also default to *Absolute Cognatic* succession.
			Basque characters now get early access to *Primogeniture* succession due to their ancient customs being aligned with the practice.
		Warfare:
			In war, occupation of the enemy's demesne is now worth the same in warscore as occupation of their vassals' settlements. This should stop the AI's all too predictable prioritization of the enemy capital.
			The *Force Vassalization* CB can no longer be used against mercenaries.
		Crusades:
			Capturing either the attacker (e.g., Pope) or the defender (e.g., Caliph) will now only result in +20% warscore instead of instantly concluding the war.
			Defenders will now fight longer / wait for more negative warscore before accepting defeat.
			Non-HF crusades (e.g., those not used by Catholics) no longer permit a white peace as an option. This was already the case with HF crusades.
			The Children's Crusade event chain can now trigger for Fraticelli characters.
			Various Holy Fury events which add gold, piety, prestige, and artifacts to the Crusade Pot now add much less, which should hopefully continue to curtail the sometimes excessive rewards upon a victorious Crusade.
			The selection of the random merchant lord to start the dynamic 4th Crusade will now prioritize Doges in addition to tier alone, will now prioritize merchant republics with capitals neighboring the Mediterranean Sea or Black Sea, and will no longer prioritize younger rulers.
		Bogomilism:
			Removed *Faith Organization* laws. While this removes a lot of the bonuses that Bogomilist rulers would get once the faith is organized, it also removes many penalties while the faith is unorganized, and starting down the path of organizing the faith no longer requires the passing of a law.
			*Patareni* and *Patareni Imperial* governments are now only available before the Bogomilist faith has been formalized. After then, Bogomilist characters cannot own Temple holdings without a penalty. This is a representation of Bogomilism's historical rejection of churches and official ecclesiastical hierarchies in its pre-formalized state and the formalization process changing their stance on churches.
			Added a government type called *Patareni Merchant Republic*. It is effectively a copy of the *Merchant Republic* government type but also allows for the holding of Temple holdings without penalty. It is automatically acquired by Bogomilist patricians before the Bogomilist faith has been formalized.
			Perfecti and Bogomilist characters with the *Theocracy* government can now take councillor positions of non-Bogomilist lieges as long as the faith is formalized (for Court Chaplain) or organized (for all other positions).
		Council:
			When the Conclave DLC is enabled, governments that use Piety or Prestige to change laws will now abide by the *Council Power* law for whether or not the Council votes on law changes.
			Pragmatist, Glory Hound, and Moneymaker councillors will now oppose lowering *Crown Authority* laws if it would mean losing a sub-law that they would not want to lose (*Protected Inheritance* for Glory Hounds and Moneymakers, *King's Peace* for landed Pragmatists and Moneymakers who are not powerful).
			*Great Councillor* minor titles now no longer appear if *Law Council Voting* is set to *Ruler*, just like the Advisor minor titles.
			Council voting logic that causes characters to favor close family members will now also cause them to favor spouses and dynasty members whom are uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, or cousins. This also means uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and cousins will not be among the preferred war targets of Pragmatist, Moneymaker, Glory Hound, and Zealot councillors.
		Sunset Invasion:
			Changed the events where the Aztec Empire is spawned so that *Medium Crown Authority* is always passed (previously it was not passed if using Conclave DLC), but *Title Revocation Allowed* is passed instead of *Free Infidel Revocation*
			Commanders and courtiers spawned for the Aztec Empire will now properly get Diplomat and Warrior traits and hidden DNA flags assigned where appropriate.
			The Aztec Empire follows a new succession law called *Aztec Elective*. The ruler and all of their vassals who are flagged as powerful vote for the new ruler from the ruler's close relatives, uncles/aunts, nephews/nieces, and cousins. People with claims to the Aztec Empire can also be voted for. Children get a heavy penalty to their voting score, but in all other ways the voting logic is identical to that of *Feudal Elective*. Unlike *Feudal Elective*, claims are not distributed to the ruler's children should they not get elected.
		Immortality:
			When failing an immortality trial results in a character being reincarnated, they now copy their old self's genetics (with a chance at mutations added on top) and caste (if relevant), but not their old self's zodiac sign (if they had one).
			The event chain for acquiring immortality can no longer remove genetic traits.
		The Demon Child will now be smarter in deciding which of its siblings it wishes to kill. It will now:
			Not kill siblings who are disinherited by means other than being a bastard.
			Not always want to kill older siblings if their liege's primary title has *Ultimogeniture* succession.
			Always want to kill younger siblings if their liege's primary title does not have *Primogeniture* or *Seniority* succession
			Always want to kill siblings of the opposite sex if their liege's gender succession laws disfavor it.
			Also cannot kill siblings who are not in the same location as them.
		The appearance of Jeanne d'Arc now requires the character to be either at war with a foe more powerful than them or in a losing war with a foe roughly equal to their power.
		Genetics:
			Players will now start with more varied genetics when it comes to polygenic phenotypes (e.g., strength, intelligence, height) that are now consistent with AI characters.
				If a character does not already start with a trait for a specific phenotype (e.g., for height, they've none of *Giant*, *Tall*, *Short*, or *Tiny*), they will now have a roughly 9% chance of receiving a dominant-dominant pair and a roughly 9% chance of receiving a recessive-recessive pair for each related gene. Previously, characters always spawned with a dominant-recessive pair (the 'perfect' average) for each gene.
			Players will now start with more positive genetics for Mendelian phenotypes (e.g., dwarfism), which are now consistent with those of the AI.
				This greatly increases the chance of dominant-dominant pairs overall and enables the chance for multiple dominant-dominant pairs of alleles for each phenotype, which in turn greatly reduces the chance for traits associated with Mendelian phenotypes (which are all negative) expressing in player offspring.
			Newly generated characters will no longer generate alleles for the health phenotype that lean towards dominant-dominant pairs.
				Previously, such characters would have a 45% chance of spawning with dominant-dominant allele pairs, a 45% chance of spawning with dominant-recessive allele pairs, and a 10% chance of spawning with recessive-recessive allele pairs. Now, the chances are 25% for dominant-dominant, 50% for dominant-recessive, and 25% for recessive-recessive.
			Changed the way negative genes are eliminated from lowborn characters marrying Duke- and higher-tier AIs in last-ditch marriage attempts.
				Instead of resetting all genes and then giving a 50% chance of spawning with a dominant-dominant pair and a 50% chance of spawning with a dominant-recessive pair for each gene, all recessive-recessive allele pairs are flipped to dominant-dominant.
			Seljuk, when ahistorically spawned, will get the same positive genetic modifications as a historical descendant of Seljuk selected to lead the invasion in later bookmarks.
			Heritable traits which are not governed by our genetics system are now also inherited by children spawned via event (if they have script-assigned parents). This type of inheritance mimics the behavior of vanilla congenital trait inheritance.
			Characters that are spawned with only one parent assigned or a true father that died before they were born will now inherit genes as if their one living parent had a child with a random character instead of assigning their genes as if they had no parents at all.
			Pregnancy and supernatural events that modify a character's genetic traits will now alter the traits' underlying genes in order to stay coherent. This improves the accuracy of the genetics system significantly.
			Characters can no longer gain or lose strength-related genetic traits through ambition and focus events.
			Handedness is now governed by EMF's genetics system and is polygenic.
				Roughly 10% of the world population will be born *Lefthanded* (previously, this was 2.5%), while a child of two *Lefthanded* characters will have a roughly 26% chance of being born *Lefthanded* instead due to genetics (previously, this was 50%). At startup, however, only about 3.3% of the world will have the *Lefthanded* trait; this is to simulate the education event chain that removes *Lefthanded* (though the underlying genetics are unaffected).
				Ambidexterity is even rarer at 1% of the world population (previously, this was 0.5%), although the child of two *Ambidextrous* characters will only have a slightly higher chance of gaining *Ambidextrous* (previously, this was 19%).
			Randomly-generated characters at game start and characters who are spawned:
				No longer have a slightly higher chance of getting favorable polygenic traits.
				Now have the same odds of spawning with certain genetic traits as if they had gone through the whole genetic inheritance system with two average parents. This generally means they are more likely to spawn with genetic traits now, as their previous odds were set too low.
			The average distribution of genes for *Dwarf* has been changed so that roughly 0.27% of the world will have it (from 0.72%). This change will not show up in games with existing characters who already had their genetics assigned, but it will affect new characters and new games.
			Characters with high health will now also be assigned genes that reflect it.
			Pregnancy events such as the ones that trigger for cravings, hoping for a warrior child, hoping for a smart child, hoping for a strong child, hoping for a beautiful child, making a vow for a child's well-being, and having visions while pregnant will now only be able to alter the child's genetics and congenital traits if the *Supernatural Events* rule is set to allow supernatural events for either of the child's parents.
		The event chain where a character gains a rival's spouse as a lover after they marry now no longer modifies the lover's traits before firing. Instead, the potential lover will be chosen based on their sex appeal, which should eliminate undesirable candidates in the first place.
		Factions:
			Rulers will now support parents, friends, and lovers for claimant factions.
			Rulers will now support parents and lovers for factions to institute *Seniority*, *Primogeniture*, or *Gavelkind* succession laws.
			A character no longer needs to have the *Diplomacy Committee* law in order to be the subject of factions to institute *Elective Monarchy* succession.
			*Crown Authority* of Low or higher will no longer protect rulers from factions to institute *Elective Monarchy* Succession.
		The Matilde bloodline can now be founded by non-feudal characters as well as King-tier characters with an Imperial government type (denoting that they are a viceroyalty).
		Mending the Schism:
			Fraticelli rulers can now mend the schism if they are not a heresy and fulfill all the requirements that a Catholic ruler would need in order to mend the schism.
			When an Orthodox (or related heresy) character mends the schism, Fraticelli characters will also have the chance to convert.
			When a Catholic or Fraticelli character mends the schism, all Orthodox heresies are now also set as Catholic heresies, in case the mainline Orthodox faith is no longer the dominant one.
			If a Bogomilist Patriarch is established while the faith is a heresy, it can no longer mend the schism and is unaffected by events that fire when the schism is mended.
			Orthodox (or related heresy) rulers can now mend the schism if Fraticelli is the dominant faith instead of Catholic.
		Religion:
			The Churching event is now open to all religions in the Christian group, not just Catholic and Orthodox characters, with one exception: Bogomilism. If the Bogomilist faith has not been formalized, the Bogomilist faithful still do not approve of churches, therefore the Churching event is unavailable to them.
			West African, Hellenic, and Aztec faiths (reformed or unreformed) can now intermarry with Christian faiths.
			Ismaili and Zaydi rulers are now more likely to accept mass conversion sponsorship events.
			Ismaili and Zaydi characters can now spawn Books on Courtesy.
			Hellenic characters can no longer receive the *Known Sodomite* modifier, can have same-sex lovers without the fear of blackmail, and no longer get penalties for revealed same-sex relations.
			Events and AI decisions related to private interactions between potential lovers who are close relatives now always take the religion of both characters into account, and now use each character's true religion instead of their publicly followed one.
			Fraticelli characters will no longer succeed at using their Chancellor to fabricate claims on lands owned by the Fraticelli pope. This mirrors the existing the case with Catholic characters and the Catholic pope.
			AI decision factors that rely on their religion being feminist will now use the character's secret religion if they have one instead of their public religion.
			Religious restrictions on the Hunting, Carousing, Seduction, and Family focuses now also apply to secret religions.
			Religious Features:
				For characters following a religion with both *Stability* and *Astrology* doctrines, when they consult the stars for signs about a newborn, the result will only modify the newborn's stats if the *Supernatural Events* rule is set to allow supernatural events for the character.
				Characters can now only die from ignoring *Haruspicy* + *Astrology* omens too much if the *Supernatural Events* rule is set to allow supernatural events for them.
				The range of intermarriable religions for Random World and recently reformed religions with the *Cosmopolitan* feature has been extended. Now, all characters within the same realm as the randomly chosen *Cosmopolitan* and all characters within any realm neighboring the top liege of the randomly chosen *Cosmopolitan* have their religions flagged as intermarriable with the given *Cosmopolitan* religion.
				Due to a bug in the base game, the *Meritocracy* religious feature is not available for players playing without the Rajas of India DLC, and heir designation will not show up as a bonus for *Harmonious* and *Civilized* if playing without Rajas of India.
		Non-independent characters using the *Endear Realm* decision can now choose to endear all their fellow vassals.
		The event for a meteorite falling into a character's garden can now trigger for non-Christian and/or non-*Feudal* characters, and can potentially trigger multiple times in a lifetime.
		The Vatican Prince event can now trigger for characters of all religions, and the baby will only lose piety if it is Catholic or Fraticelli.
		Societies:
			When using the *Invite an Ascetic* society power as a character following a feminist religion, female ascetics no longer have a significantly smaller chance of appearing than male ascetics.
			The Hermetic Society ward-making event can now fire without *Supernatural Events* or *Devil Worshipers* rules being turned on. However, should *Devil Worshipers* be turned on, the wards it creates will now also protect from the *Corrupt Priest* and *Dark Possession* actions.		
			Hermetic Society Apprentices:
				Characters who cannot join the Hermetic Society can no longer become hermetic apprentices.
				If an AI hermetic apprentice loses their title for whatever reason, they will now leave the Hermetic Society if they are not interested in staying.
				Characters who are already in the Hermetic Society and have a higher rank than their liege can no longer become their liege's hermetic apprentice.
		Made the events where the character has sex with a stranger have consistent effects. This affects events in the pilgrimage event chains, feast events for characters with Dharmic religions, the 'Holy Seclusion' event chain for *Lustful* characters, and Way of Life seduction events. Female impregnation chance from these events strictly depends on the characters' fertility, and there is now always a chance to catch venerial diseases.
		The 'Stressed and in Command' event will now trigger for characters without the *Drunkard* trait.
		The special tribal building *Magyar Divisions* for Magyars prior to their migration into the Carpathians, which affects levy size by -50%, should now be removed automatically if it passes from the Magyar realm.
		Ambitions:
			*Win a Holy War* no longer gives a permanent martial skill bonus but instead a modifier, lasting 10 years, with +1 Martial, +3 Church Opinion, and monthly piety. Ambition cannot be taken again until the success modifier expires.
			*Win a War* no longer gives a permanent martial skill bonus but instead a modifier, lasting 10 years, with +1 Martial and monthly prestige. Ambition cannot be taken again until the success modifier expires.
			*Forge a Bloodline*:
				Abandoning this ambition no longer gives -1000 prestige.
				This ambition now has the same trait requirements as the *Become Exalted* ambition, i.e., either *Ambitious*, *Proud*, *Envious*, or be a tier higher than Duke while also having none of *Humble*, *Content*, or *Shy*.
				The AI will now properly take this ambition when appropriate, whereas before an unfortunately malformed check prevented all AIs without a historical bloodline from taking this ambition.
				Unlanded patricians can now take this ambition.
		Pregnancy:
			The Virgin Birth event chain works slightly differently.
				Now, a secret impregnation fires first between the woman and an unnamed character, and only 2 months after this event does the actual prompt for the characters show up, also granting the Pregnant trait to the woman.
				The husband's response can now also apply the same modifiers as if the wife were adulterous.
				This change also means that pregnancy flavor events now fire properly for pregnancies caused by this event chain. This event chain can now also cause hard pregnancies.
			Regular pregnancies no longer have a slightly lower chance of becoming hard pregnancies.
			Pregnancies out of wedlock no longer have a much higher chance of becoming hard pregnancies.
		Antagonize Events:
			The event where the antagonizer sends a courtesan to their victim:
				Will no longer send courtesans of the wrong gender to homosexual characters.
				Now only has a 50% chance of giving the victim a disease, to make it consistent with other instances of unprotected sex. However, if Sunset Invasion is enabled and the Aztecs have arrived, there is a chance that the disease the character gets will be the Aztec disease.
			After a character gets food poisoning from the antagonize event where a poisoned boar is sent, relevant announcements will be made to human relatives and their court physician will immediately try to help.
		The nomad wrestling event chain can now trigger for females and target females under the right circumstances.
		Court Physicians:
			When the Court Physician minor title is assigned:
				All sick courtiers who are eligible for treatment will immediately seek treatment. Previously, newly assigned Court Physicians would not treat courtiers who became sick before the minor title was assigned. Note that due to the way eligibility for treatment is calculated, players will not be able to cheese treatment results by unassigning and then reassigning their Court Physician.
			The prompt about what to do with a sickly infant will now fire for all guardians in the court with sickly children whose fate has not been decided yet due to there being no court physician at the time of their birth.
			Sick courtiers in courts with a court physician will now intermittently seek treatment the same way playable characters do with the *Seek Treatment* decision. This means that unlanded characters with long-duration diseases such as cancer will regularly get new treatments once their old one expires.
			Court Physicians of Hindu characters no longer need to belong to the *Brahmin* caste.
			Events that spawn characters to act as court physicians will now always spawn characters with genders that would actually let them be court physicians should they be manually assigned the title.
		*Giant* no longer counts as a (combat) disability and *Tiny* now counts as a minor (combat) disability instead of a medium one.
		The Piers upgrade for Great Works now gives +2.5% local tax instead of +0.25%.
		Holmgangs can now happen against and between female characters as long as they are eligible for duels.
		The seclusion event where a character and a courtier become lovers now properly takes age, traits, and sexual preferences into account and can now trigger between characters who are married or are consorts.
		If a Court Chaplain is on assignment to *Hunt Apostates* when the game rule *Devil Worshipers* is disabled, they are now less likely to accuse an innocent of being a heretic than previously.
		The flavor event for having a good steward can now trigger if any demesne province has 1% revolt risk (from 2%).
		If *Gender Equality* is not set to *Full*, then administrators, engineers, and physicians that come from China will now always be male (from 4.76% of being female). This also means that characters following religions with *Enatic Clans* will not be able to ask for physicians from China. If *Gender Equality* is set to *Full*, then invaders, abducted engineers, and merchants from China will now also have a 50% chance of being female.
		Characters can now take the "Become a Councillor" set of ambitions even if they belong to a different religious group than their liege.
		When a Mufti is caught pocketing money meant for charity, allowing them to go free if they return the money will now deduct Piety. This event option increased decadence in vanilla, but because the vanilla decadence system is not used in EMF, it needed to apply some other penalty.
	*MINOR CHANGES:*
		Councillors' cooldown on job reassignment has been dropped to 56 days (8 weeks) from 92 days.
		Upon campaign initialization, EMF will now remove all extranneous claims from characters (either the claim is to a title that is unheld or the title is actually held by the character already).
		The chances for pregnancy are no longer printed in the tooltips of event options that result in unprotected sex.
		Count-tier AI characters will now use the *Employ Court Physician* decision even if they have no relatives played by human players.
		Cleaned-up the tooltips predominantly seen when viewing war success/whitepeace/defeat tooltips which affect a) the moods of the 4-interest factions and b) the reduction of *Crown Authority* and *Tribal Organization*.
		If a lover of a character who is in the same society gets caught as an apostate, the character will now be notified. This was previously only the case for friends, close relatives, and characters in the same realm.
		Duels between spouses can now spark romance.
		When Robin Hood and Maid Marion are spawned via event, they are now spawned as lovers.
		Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi will now spawn as a Sunni.
		[Vanilla Map] Conan the Young now spawns with the *Short* trait instead of *Dwarf*, and Hasan the Little now spawns with the *Tiny* trait instead of *Dwarf*.
		[SWMH] If the Chinese emperor likes Latino-Iberians, they will also like characters from the Italian cultural group.
		The event where a small mercenary band is stumbled upon after looting a settlement can now spawn a female mercenary captain if the settlement owner follows a feminist religion.
		When a goldsmith character is spawned for creating crown jewels, their gender determination follows *Status of Women* laws, *Gender Equality* game rules, and religious stances on gender much more closely.
		When a mercenary captain performs the *Carouse with the Men* decision, they no longer have 2% chance to gain *Lover's Pox*. Instead, if they prefer men, they have a 5% chance to trigger the unprotected sex with a stranger effect.
		[SWMH] Characters in the Italian cultural group get the same bonus to founding Alexander the Great's bloodline as characters in the Latin cultural group.
		When a valiant knight offers their services during the HF coronation event chain, they have a chance of spawning with the *Crusader* trait after the first Crusade has happened, not after the year 1100.
		During the event where a Christian priest is spawned and imprisoned by a *Zealous*, Muslim ruler, the Christian priest will not spawn as a Catholic if the Catholic religion is a heresy, and instead of always being Saxon, their culture and graphical culture will match that of a random province matching their religion.
		Characters whose religion belongs to the Zoroastrian group will study the Shahnameh instead of St. Augustine's Confessions when trying to improve their learning.
		The final rank in the Advaita Matha society now gives -15% fertility instead of +15% fertility.
		The Parrots Flock to Your Banner event chain can now trigger for AI characters.
		The Image of Edessa artifact can no longer be gifted to Iconoclast characters.
		The Weeping Statue artifact is no longer active under Iconoclast characters should they acquire it somehow.
		[Vanilla Map] The birthdate of Olga of Kiev has been changed from 890 to 909, and the date at which she marries Igor of Kieve has been changed from 920 to 933. This is in accordance with the Russian Primary Chronicle's dates as interpreted by Constantin Zuckerman, which puts all dates in the 9th and early 10th centuries forward by about 30-40 years compared to older interpretations. It also makes the birth of Svyatoslav in 942 internally consistent with Crusader King 2's rules for pregnanciess.
		The tunnel sneaker during the seclusion event chain will be less likely to have the nickname "the Handsome" if someone in the character's court already has that nickname.
		The chances of getting something tangible out of the looted chest event chain will no longer decrease if *Supernatural Events* are set to *On* or *Unrestricted*.
		Female feudal lords can now demand hunting rights in a province.
		The event where a feudal lord demands Prima Nocta rights has been disabled due to Prima Nocta never having existed in reality (it was made up by 16th-19th century historians for propaganda purposes).
		The ambitions to improve an attribute are now available to unlanded characters, even when playing with Way of Life enabled. This is partly because unlanded characters do not get access to focuses.
		Freckles will now appear on baron-tier and spawned characters if their graphical culture is appropriate. They can also now appear on unlanded characters in courts of characters who are not eligible for freckles (where appropriate).
		The silly event for slaying the king of the forest can now trigger for immortal characters and female homosexuals.
		Dynasty members of varying relations can now become admirers of a child of destiny as long as their religion allows it.
		Sparring partners gained by event through the War focus can now be female if they are eligible for duels.
		The religious branch of newly spawned characters following a pagan religion with no head is now influenced by that character's traits and religious features.
		The monastic order powers *Give Spiritual Guidance* and *Teach Virtue*, which randomly remove a vice or add a virtue to a character respectively, will now send you a notification message (High-Priority Alert) telling you which trait was removed or added after you take the decision.
		Buddhism is no longer flagged as polytheistic and its high god name is now "the Buddha" instead of "Brahma".
		During the Inn event chain, the available options to name the inn have been made more appropriate to the character (e.g. "Desert Watering Hole" is only available if the character has a desert province in their realm).
	*FIXES:*
		Warrior societies can no longer end up deciding to raid the court of the All-Seeing Isis, possibly killing her and her special courtiers (though they would all be resurrected instantly, of course).
		Fixed an issue where the AI would not properly cycle between certain ambitions such as *Make a Friend*, *Create a Treasury*, *Strengthen Religion*, and *Build a Wonder*.
		Certain 4-interest faction actions related to wealth transfer would previously process 30 gold for King-tier vassals instead of the intended 40 gold.
		Localisation:
			The narrative event which fires upon the death of Genghis Khan (or a successor) and the 3-way Mongol Empire split into the Golden Horde, il-Khanate, and Chagataid Khanate (Moghul Khanate) will now properly display the names of the leaders of the 3 successor empires in the event text rather than those portions appearing blank.
			When Seljuk (or his descendant) wins their first adventure war, the narrative event will no longer incorrectly reference the player as if they were Seljuk in part of the event text. It will also display the dynamic origin of the Seljuk Invader.
			The tooltip for the button to reform a pagan religion will no longer claim you need 3 Holy Sites and 50 Moral Authority, the vanilla values, when in EMF you need 4 and only 30, respectively.
		[Vanilla] Events regarding the Siculo-Arabic melting pot will no longer fire without SWMH enabled, because the culture is only present in SWMH.
		Government Types:
			Bön Reformed characters no longer revert to *Feudal* instead of *Monastic Feudal* when switching governments from event.
			Selling land to a friend for a favor will no longer sometimes cause them to adopt an incorrect government type.
			Nomadic raiders settling down to sold land will no longer sometimes adopt an incorrect government type.
			*Patareni Imperial* government (Bogomilist) is now properly accepted by *Tribal* and *Theocracy* vassals.
		Bön characters will now correctly default to *Absolute Cognatic Succession* if playing without religious features.
		Fixed multiple instances where characters spawned during decisions or events did not properly get Diplomat and Warrior traits and were not properly assigned hidden DNA flags.
		Bastards spawned by event wherein one of the parents is unknown will now be subject to genes from their known parent mixed with genes given from a genetically randomized background character.
		[SWMH] The event option to force open China through trade route dominance no longer requires owning provinces in Europe.
		Fixed situations where certain spawned Hindu characters would always spawn with the *Kshatriya* caste, even when they were spawned for someone in another caste.
		Non-Isma'ili apprentices in training for the Assassins who fail are no longer converted to Isma'ili once the event chain concludes.
		Fixed situations where ascetic characters would get ascetic traits from the wrong religion.
		Random World:
			Religions that spawned with the *Dogmatic* or *Cosmopolitan* feature would not properly apply the effects of said features.
			Religions spawned with the *Dogmatic* feature and recently reformed religions with the *Dogmatic* feature would not remove intermarrying capabilities from all religions.
		A number of warscore checks were not WAD, which caused the AI to not properly recognize when to use or not use decisions and event options that would help in winning a war.
		Spawned children of a victorious, female revolter will no longer blindly mark her as their father instead of mother.
		Genetics:
			Positive genetic modifications now work properly on newly spawned characters. The issue was due to their genes not being assigned immediately upon spawn but only when a child of theirs was spawned.
			Positive genetic modifications may now modify genes controlling health (more of an oversight than a fix).
			Certain genetic traits no longer have a much higher chance of being inherited by *History's Forgotten Daughters*, which are generated at game startup.
			Characters without any trait for a polygenic (spectrum) phenotype can no longer have genes that would ordinarily make not having a trait for that phenotype impossible.
			Issues with trait exclusivity (opposites):
				Characters no longer lose the *Perceptive* trait if they acquire [non-congenital] *Dull* or *One-Eyed*.
				Characters can now be both *Perceptive* and either *Slow* or *Imbecile*, as the two traits are governed by different genes.
				Characters can now express *Weak* if they also have *Imposing* or *Powerful Voice*. Strength has nothing to do with the latter two traits.
			Characters without the *Dwarf* trait can no longer spawn with genetics that would normally have a 100% chance of expressing *Dwarf*.
			When a character acquires a genetic trait governed by the genetics system through an event, mutation, or spawning with it, they will now spawn with genes that are more similar to the genetic makeup of characters who inherited the trait from their parents. Among other things, this means characters without any genetic traits at the start of the game will have a harder time having children with genetic traits with a partner who also has no genetic traits.
			Characters born or spawned with the *Dwarf* trait can no longer get it removed by mutations in the height phenotype.
		Rulers in the Indian religious group, while they could pass *Elective Monarchy Succession*, could not take part in factions to institute it.
		Characters can no longer improperly get more than one terrain leadership trait via event.
		Mending the Schism as a Bogomilist will now properly set the Catholic religion to be a heresy of Bogomilism.
		[SWMH] Fixed minor bits of code that checked for and/or processed Italian culture instead of the Italian cultural group.
		When playing with Conclave DLC enabled, having *Title Revocation Allowed* or *Free Infidel Revocation* will now properly cause AI vassals to be more likely to join factions to lower *Crown Authority*.
		[SWMH] Low German characters can now found the Teutonic Order.
		[SWMH] Characters belonging to the German, Low German, Dutch, Turkmen, or Turkish cultures will no longer convert back to the cultures from which their melting pot originated if their capital becomes that culture.
		The event for a guardian to teach their ward about knightlihood can now trigger for AIs, can now trigger for female guardians if they are allowed to be commanders, and can now trigger for children of all feminist religions (not just Cathar and Messalian ones). Its outcome where a child becomes *Robust* can now also trigger for characters with *Strong* or *Burly*.
		Monophysite and Coptic children of non-Monophysite and non-Coptic parents will no longer ask them if they can become an ascetic.
		Characters who become incapable from illness now properly can no longer take decisions or trigger events that are unavailable to incapable characters.
		Bloodlines:
			[SWMH] The Mathilde bloodline now properly grants +5 opinion with all characters belonging to the Italian cultural group.
			The Legendary Commander bloodline effect of attracting better commanders now properly works with the *Invite Soldier to Court* decision.
			[SWMH] The Phalaris bloodline no longer deactivates on characters belonging to the Italian cultural group.
			Saintly bloodlines for the Germanic, Romuva, Slavic, Tengri, Suomenusko, Aztec, West African, Zun, Hellenic, and Bön religions that enable events for zealots to spawn in a character's capitol now actually say this in their bloodline description.
			Bloodlines that said they would cause more council members to take the Loyalist voting position will now actually work.
			Adjusted some discrepancies in historical bloodline effects between vanilla and SWMH versions.
			The Eleanor of Aquitaine bloodline no longer confers Personal Combat Skill bonus, giving instead an extra Prestige.
			The Alexander Nevsky bloodline no longer confers opinion bonus from Orthodox characters, giving instead bonus to defensive morale.
			The Basil bloodline no longer confers opinion bonus from Orthodox characters, giving instead bonus to Personal Combat Skill and offensive morale.
			The Almoraivd and Almohad bloodlines now confer bonus command modifier against religious enemies.
			The Fatimid bloodline no longer confers bonus to Personal Combat Skill and opinion bonus from Shiite/Ismaili characters, giving instead opinion bonus from Maghreb Arabic characters.
			[SWMH] The Almohad bloodline now also confers opinion bonus from Masmuda characters.
		*Justice Committee* now properly also covers the decisions *Throw in the Brazen Bull*, *Embalm Prisoner*, and *Burn (Character)*, and council members have voting logic for these decisions.
		The Children's Crusade now has a regular chance of triggering in worlds with the French HRE.
		The emperor of the French HRE and the emperor of a restored Roman Empire can no longer gift their crowns to the Chinese emperor.
		Numerous events that previously only fired for Catholic characters now also fire for Fraticelli ones.
		Events that imply a character had sex with someone will now properly process this effect. This primarily affects a lot of events that add the *Lustful* trait and/or remove the *Celibate* trait.
		The Shephard's Crusade can now properly target kingdoms in Iberia if the *Ahistorical Empires* option is not set to On.
		Restoring the Zoroastrian Priesthood as a Zurvanist or Khurmazta character will no longer cause the head of the restored priesthood to be Zoroastrian.
		[Vanilla Map] The birth of Sviatoslav I of Kiev by event will now happen at its intended time, and it is now prevented if either of his parents are Celibate, prisoners, or incapable, or if his father is a Eunuch.
		[SWMH] The event where the traps upgrade in a Great Work kills courtiers will now work properly, and the event where a character can gain either prestige or an opinion boost from their liege for having a Great Work in their demesne will no longer trigger for independent characters.
		[SWMH] Added the missing decision to create the Drahla's Children holy order.
		Event options where favors are offered as payment will now only appear when playing with Conclave enabled.
		Targets selected for a coronation duel that happens during non-HF coronation events will now always properly be targets who could actually duel each other.
		Acquiring a trait or a modifier that disallows the focus that the character currently has will now properly remove the focus.
		The events for suggesting a new Chief Qadi will now properly trigger.
		During the event chain where a character can approach a hedonist friend for advice, chaste, Muslim characters who choose not to approach their friend will now properly get to choose between hedonism and poetry instead of hedonism and celibacy.
	*VANILLA FIXES:*
		When asking your religious head for repentance of your sins and your religious head asks for you to make a sacrifice in order to return to the Church:
			The option to send a son or daughter to a monastery now actually works and will actually be asked of you sometimes.
			The option to impose *Gavelkind Succession* upon your primary title can no longer trigger if your succession law is *Imperial Elective* (i.e., you're the Byzantine Empire).
		It should no longer be possible for the Catholic Pope to switch the 4th Crusade target away from Thessalonika / Thrace (the proper de jure kingdom for the 4th Crusade, i.e., of Constantinople).
		Improper Marriages:
			Disobedient children will no longer elope with characters they should not be allowed to marry (e.g., siblings).
			Baptism sponsors will now only ask for a marriage alliance if they can actually marry the character.
			Banished smiths from courts will now only marry eloped lovers if they are allowed to marry (e.g., they are the opposite sex, they are not siblings, etc.).
			Seclusion events will no longer sometimes cause same sex marriages.
		Fixed localization for the government features "Cannot Create Kingdoms" and "Cannot Usurp Kingdoms and Empires" so that it is no longer hardcoded to show as "Theocracies, Holy Orders, and Mercenaries" and "Merchant Republics and Patricians" respectively.
		The Hansa will no longer always spawn with German, Catholic characters. Instead, the religion and culture of its characters will depend on the religion and culture of the province in which it spawns.
		When negotiating with China to open up, they will no longer demand eunuch characters to be their concubine.
		Fixed an issue where the supernatural event "Weird Village" during the pilgrimage event chain would actually only trigger if *Supernatural Events* were turned off.

		Characters following religions with the *Holy Family* or *Dawnbreakers* feature no longer suffer penalties for trying to seduce a close relative.
		The event for giving land to a friend for a favor will now only trigger if the character's gender succession laws allow it (so e.g. male friends are disallowed under *Enatic* succession).
		The event where a character prays to remove the *Stutter* trait will now properly remove the trait if successful instead of removing the *Lisp* trait.
		Characters with that have both the *Stutter* and *Lisp* traits will now properly get negative events corresponding to both traits.
		The *Harelip* trait will no longer prevent negative events from the Stutter and/or Lisp traits from firing.
		[Vanilla Map] Matilda of Flanders no spawns with the Dwarf trait. She was actually of average height, but was misreported as being abnormally short.
		*Lustful* Messalian characters in holy seclusion who gain a lover from the event chain can now also gain lovers whom are close relatives.
		Tengri, Aztec, and West African characters can now properly intermarry with their respective reformed faiths.
		Hellenic religions of the reformed and unreformed variety are now properly treated as if they have the *Astrology* and *Haruspicy* features built-in when processing synergy events.
		Aztec religions of the reformed and unreformed variety are now properly treated as if they have the *Bloodthirsty Gods* feature built-in when processing synergy events and Great Works upgrades.
		The *Drill Troops*, *Endear Realm*, and *Dissolve Factions* decisions can no longer be taken if incapable.
		The event where a character's Court Physician gives them a potion to stop being *Depressed* can now properly result in the potion working.
		Under *Imperial Elective* succession, marshals and commanders who lose their post due to being hired/transfered to be advisors will no longer cause the emperor to lose credibility.
		The leader of the Children's Crusade can now also be female if the *Gender Equality* rule is set to Full.
		The incest court rumors event chain can now trigger for religions in the Zoroastrian group that do not believe in divine marriage and can no longer trigger for non-Zoroastrian religions that do believe in divine marriage.
		Ecstatic elders under *Eldership* succession will now properly subtract 60 from their candidate score if the chosen candidate is a rival of theirs or is deemed incapable instead of adding 60.
		The Sentinels of Light warrior society will no longer appear for *Zealous*, non-Bön characters.
		The *Summon Lodge Commander* decision will no longer spawn multiple characters if the spawner's religion does not have the *Enatic Clans* feature.
		When asking for a coronation from the Pope as a de jure vassal king of an empire with *Free Investiture*, it is no longer possible for the Pope to ask for *Religion Head Investiture* law in exchange for your coronation, because setting the law on your primary [de jure vassal kingdom] title will have no effect since its crown laws are governed by the empire.
		The *Plot to Weaken Fellow Vassal* no longer incorrectly prevents the AI from activating the plot if they have the highest-tier of plot support (plot power & number of plot backers).
		In case of twins, pregnancy events that can modify a newborn's congenital traits will now properly have a chance to modify the traits of both children.
		Combat Tactics:
			Nomads now correctly benefit from the *Skirmish Tactics* and *Melee Tactics* technologies.
			If a non-independent ruler is leading a flank in their own army, the code which checks *Skirmish Tactics* and *Melee Tactics* technology levels for tactic selection will no longer use the technology level of that non-independent ruler's liege rather than their own.
		Two characters of the same sex can no longer become lovers through the warrior lodge ritual hunting event chain if they are not both homosexual.
		AI characters will no longer use the *Drink from the Fountain of Youth* decision if the *Supernatural Events* rule is not set to Unrestricted.
		The boardgame event carousing event chain now properly checks for the Apprentice Boardgamer modifier before firing and properly considers traits to determine the outcome.
		Events that triggered for Muslim characters regarding polygamy will now also trigger for non-Muslim characters with polygamy.
		Tooltips for the Meliorism event chain will now properly display the chances to upgrade a character's education trait even if the religion the character is following does not have the *Agnatic Clans*, *Enatic Clans*, or *Meritocracy* features.
		Reforming the Aztec faith with the *Autonomous* feature will now properly grant +2 martial.
		In the event where a character can try to emulate the founder of a bloodline, the option available for Possessed characters if the bloodline founder was a cannibal will now properly add the Cannibal trait.
		The event where a smith creates cheap weapons/armor for a character no longer creates duplicates.
		When a player character's spouse or child who is imprisoned by a different character catches a disease, the player no longer has the option to immediately free the imprisoned character.
		The option to join a monastic society in the event where a monastic society helps someone with a monastic saintly bloodline can now only be taken by characters who are actually eligible to join.
		China:
			If the Chinese Emperor/Empress has the Sayyid, Saoshyant, or Saoshyant Descendant traits, any Chinese princes and princesses that have the Emperor/Empress set as a parent will inherit these traits properly.
			The Sayyid, Mirza, and Saoshyant Descendant traits now inherit properly when the Emperor/Empress of China changes to a new one of the same dynasty as the previous Emperor/Empress.
			If an existing Chinese Emperor/Empress is a member of a bloodline, new Chinese Emperors and Empresses of the same dynasty as the old one will now also be members of that bloodline. Currently this system ignores the bloodline's inheritance setting due to lack of mod support for this sort of thing.
		Newborn babies spawned by events such as the Hollow Baby event or various bastard-spawning events will now properly be subject to the same events that babies born outside of events are subjected to. Among other things, this means they can acquire or inherit Wolf's Blood, will properly show up in the chronicle, and will properly get Sayyid, Saoshyant Descendant, and Mirza traits.
		Horse Lords Dynamic Mercenary Companies:
			Male characters can be sent to become leaders of dynamic mercenary companies even under *Enatic Clans*.
			Female characters with the Shieldmaiden trait can be sent to become leaders of dynamic mercenary companies as long as it is done by a character who accepts shieldmaidens.
			Mothers can now send their children to become leaders of dynamic mercenary companies.
			Ascetic characters and characters with the Perfecti trait can no longer be sent to become leaders of dynamic mercenary companies.
			Any dynasty member of the dynamic mercenary company's creator can dissolve the dynamic mercenary company, though the AI will never do this if any living dynasty member is a human player.
			Elope events now happen more sensibly. Close relatives will only elope if their religion has divine blood, incapable, celibate, and eunuch characters will not elope, and characters will not elope to mercenary leaders who are prisoners, incapable, or eunuchs.
			The duel event can now feature female challengers and the resulting rivalries will be with the challenger's liege instead of with their father (since their liege could be their mother). It will also no longer trigger between characters who are friends or lovers.
			The event for passing on the Mercenary Traditions modifier to children will now also work if the child's mother had the modifier. It will also work if the given parent is dead at the time the event triggers.
		The event that gives a random modifiers to courtiers will now only give modifers that a given courtier could feasibly get if they were landed and went through the appropriate event chain.
		AI characters will no longer invite other AI characters to join the Cult of Kali society if it is full.
		Characters killed in duels during the feast event chain will now properly mark their killer.
		When a child throws mud at the guests during the tribal festival event chain, the opinion modifiers that the other guests get in response are now properly directly at the mud-thrower.
		The warrior lodge crucible steel weapon event chain will now properly process its secondary targets (the weapon forger, witnesses of heresy, victim child).
		AI characters will now properly decline duels based on their traits.
		Secret religious ceremonies that can make another character a lover will not trigger for close relatives if they do not follow a religion with divine blood.
		Events for secret religious cults for a reformed Hellenic faith will now properly display their descriptions.
		If a character is killed by a sneaky assassin while in seclusion, their killer will now be properly set to the sneaky assassin instead of themselves.
		If playing without Way of Life, the event where a spouse confronts a character about a lover can no longer target two different lovers over the course of the event chain.
		Events and decisions that check for whether or not a character has a crusader trait will now properly recognize the Kailash Guardian trait.
		The pope can no longer ask for *Gavelkind* succession to lift excommunication on nomadic, theocracy, or republic characters.
		During the saintly pilgrimage event chain, running away from a bear will now properly continue the event chain.
		Sunni and Ismaili moral authority will now properly be reduced from the rebirth of Zoroastrianism instead of being reduced every time a Saoshyant descendant is born/spawned.
		The event where a character considers legitimizing a bastard now takes gender succession laws into account, and its three options will always apply to the same bastard if the character has multiple.
		Characters who are at war or are inaccessible when the event for getting a new pet dog from their bloodline would fire will now properly see the same event later on once they are no longer at war and at accessible.
		The game will now properly determine the quality of a happiness potion based on its ingredients if only one ingredient was added.
		When a character is Incapable, attempts suicide, and fails, they will be able to attempt again in a year, just like if they had attempted suicide without being Incapable.
		Great knights and great poets spawned by the Valiant Blood bloodline will now properly be less likely to spawn in the court of someone who already has some great knights and/or poets in their court.
		The event for refreshing a trade route in the steppes, Persia, or the Himalayas that was granted by an event chain through Business focus will now properly refresh the province modifier.
		Under polygamy, secondary wives will only attempt to kill a primary heir child if their spouse's primary title follows *Primogeniture*, *Ultimogeniture*, *Gavelkind*, or *Open* succession.
		When sending a physician to China, their traits' contribution to their score will now be calculated properly, and their score will be modified properly if the Chinese emperor/empress likes or dislikes them.
		For immortal characters, certain events and decisions that rely on age will now use the age at which the character became immortal rather than their actual age. Among other things, this means negative health-, fertility-, combat-, and pregnancy-related effects will be less likely to happen for characters who became immortal at a young age.
		Inheritance of Wolf's Blood will now properly take bastardry into account.
		Fixed certain event outcomes and options not taking the *Supernatural Events* rule properly into account.
		Meddling mothers will no longer seduce male spouses if either of them are Homosexual, and they will no longer seduce spouses at all if either of them are Celibate or the spouse is a Eunuch.
		Court rumor events and lover events without Way of Life enabled will now properly trigger for unlanded characters.
		The Glitterhoof event can now trigger even if a character has no chancellor.
		The Spymaster Mittens event can now trigger multiple times in a character's lifetime and now will not trigger if Glitterhoof is the character's spymaster.
		The Terrible Sword and Terrible Armor artifacts now have proper flags that lets the game recognize them for calculating scores in artifact-based events and decisions.
		Fixed the Anarchy event chain so that its triggers and results make sense. It can now fire for Henry I even if the game starts before he becomes king, requires Henry I to be King of England upon his death to fire, requires Mathilda and Stephen to both be alive, and cannot fire if the Kingdom of England has *Agnatic* succession. Stephen needs to be capable and not be a prisoner for him to fight back, Mathilda needs to be capable and not a prisoner for Stephen to accept her, and Mathilda's spouse needs to be landed and capable to fight Stephen.
		Fixed various events related to minor titles that only checked courtiers for minor titles, not vassals.
		Warrior lodge members can now properly be assigned on quests to duel characters of the opposite sex as long as they are eligible for dueling.
		When deciding to pledge for or against a crusade, de jure vassals of the target title's de jure empire title are now properly more likely to pledge for both sides. If *Ahistorical Empires* is set to off, this will instead apply to the de jure vassals of the title's de jure kingdom.
		When reforming a pagan religion with no religious head, only adults will get the chance to pick their branch should they convert to the reformed religion.
		If a ruler dies after starting off the Holy Fury coronation event chain but before the event chain finishes, characters travelling to the coronation will now properly get their travelling status removed.
		When a spouse or a child of a tribal or nomad ruler without a court physician gets sick, the random courtier that can get selected to become the new court physician will now always be one whose age and gender allow it.
		Reformed Hellenic characters will no longer get rumors for artifacts they would not be able to get.
		Councillors who find artifacts can no longer be rewarded with a favor if they are already owed a favor.
		Battlefied duels and special actions during battlefield events will no longer prevent future battlefield events from taking place.
		Events that add or remove the Bastard trait will now also immediately recalculate succession for the character to fix succession issues.
		Characters with the Scholar trait spawned by one of the Interesting Muslims events will now spawn with the Faqih trait instead, as the Scholar trait is supposed to be unavailable to muslims.
		AI characters will now properly be more likely to sway lieges who are human players.
	*MODDING:*
		The character flag names used to represent allele pairs in EMF's DNA module have been shortened in order to help reduce clutter when using `charinfo` / `debug_mode` to view character data. If your scripts are manipulating or checking the old flag names, they will need to be updated. EMF will automatically translate the old flag names to the new whenever loading an older savegame.


EMF 10.1 [2019-07-23]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		Cadet Dynasties:
			AIs will now sometimes form their own cadet branches of large dynasties (sometimes even cadet branches of large cadet dynasties if you play long enough).
			In short, a cadet is a member of the dynasty that isn't closely related to the current dynasty head (though some factors reduce the degree to which they must be distant), has no titles to inherit of their own, and is a second son (has an elder sibling that technically could inherit -- if there's anything to inherit).
			A cadet can form a cadet dynasty if their current dynasty has at least 30 living members, they manage to somehow gain a title of Count- or higher-tier and have at least one eligible heir (according to their laws) to those titles. Theocracies and republics cannot form cadet dynasties, although patricians, feudals (including imperial), and tribal rulers can.
			Cadet dynasties track their parent dynasty (and grandparent dynasty and so on if applicable), so we can start to include special cases for child-parent dynastic relations in elective succession, the claimant faction, and other such places where favoring a dynasty over another matters.
				This work isn't yet ready (it's going to take a long time to overhaul the notion of dynastic relation in this game), but you can at least see the relations tracked by hovering over the character portrait tooltip of a [living] cadet dynasty member: after their, e.g., "Dynasty: de Milano-Portucale" line on the tooltip, you'd see a "Parent Dynasty: Welf-Milano" line and, in this example, a "Grandparent Dynasty: Welf" line after that.
			Naming (and qualification) of the cadet dynasties has been very carefully designed to model the patterns of the most well-known dynasty for its many cadet branches: the Capets, and in general, Western European and German practices. It also works very hard to pick names that will be distinct, plausible, and help show the dynasty's origin at a glance. For cultures that use founder-named dynasties, we simply let the hard-code name the new dynasty after the founder -- not much that we can do to enhance that with the tools available.
			Caveats:
				The CoA (Coats of Arms) for new cadet dynasties is something that we cannot control from script (it's random) -- and if you think about it, it's a pretty hard problem for a computer, as it's largely one of aesthetic -- although those with a little modding know-how can alter the CoAs to their heart's content.
				After careful consideration of how much having a positive opinion modifier between parent and child dynasties would cost in terms of performance (every cadet dynasty member having a soft-coded opinion modifier of like +3 since "Same Dynasty" is +5 to every parent cadet dynasty member and vice versa, wherein at least one of those dynasties is definitely large), it was deemed not worth it for the paltry opinion boost and potentially big performance hit in extreme situations. [The current "Same Dynasty" opinion is hard-coded and doesn't have any non-negligible performance hit at all.] What really matters is how the AI votes, favors claimants, etc.
			We plan to do more with this feature beyond what we've already mentioned. At the very least, we'd like to give players the option to form their own cadet dynasty under certain circumstances (much less restrictive than for the AI), but alas, that is future work.
			Tips:
				Though this feature is *really* neat, it's not designed to spawn cadet dynasties left and right. That would be ahistorical and a bit disruptive to normal gameplay. Thus, if you want to see them or get a cadet branch or two of your very own, then the easiest way to do that is to play fairly large (i.e., total -- alive or dead -- member count) dynasties at later start dates where the ancestral trees already have many branches and a lot more dynastic rulers have laws like *Primogeniture* which will not split title inheritance upon succession (disinheriting most of the second sons which would still be heir to titles with *Gavelkind*).
				One typically needs to play quite awhile (at least 50 years realistically, but we'd expect more like 100 years under more average conditions) before the conditions are right for a cadet branch to form.
		Game Rules:
			*Intermediate Genetic Traits:*
				With the recent addition of a number of new congenital traits upon various spectrums (height, attractiveness, intelligence, strength, etc.) in EMF and the fact that the most middle-of-the-spectrum (just barely above or below average) traits have very little immediate gameplay effect but, in the opinion of some of our players, dilute character congenital traits overall if you have to see them all the time, we've introduced this new game rule to allow you to hide or show these "in-between" traits. [We cannot remove them entirely, as they are important to the genetics system working as designed, among other feasibility reasons.]
				By default, the intermediate spectrum traits (e.g., *Bright*, *Dim*, *Delicate*, *Burly*, etc.) will be hidden, in keeping with the idea that the more "vanilla-like" option is the default, but this is now within your control. If you feel like the new genetics system introduced a bunch of trait spam, then the default is for you. If you enjoy seeing the greater variety (and thus total number) of genetic variations, then the *Visible* option to the game rule is for you.
	*CHANGES:*
		Genetics:
			To reduce the surprise / randomness factor for players and their first generation of offspring, player genes are now initialized to be either straight average (all heterozygous allele pairs) or a chance at slightly above average immediately when the game starts rather than mixing them according to standard genetic probability distributions as per normal. However, if the player character *does* have genetic trait(s), their DNA will still be set according to those traits in the normal fashion. This essentially just removes most of the randomness component from your first generation (though of course your spouse/consort's DNA is not given this treatment, and that will obviously matter still).
			Improved the accuracy of detecting randomly-generated characters on game initialization such that it is even more unlikely for a historically-scripted ruler to have their genetic traits modified at all.
			Some of the modifiers of the intermediate genetic traits (see the game rule described in *NEW FEATURES*) have been eliminated (not even the tiniest of general vassal opinion boosts or maluses, e.g.). This is to emphasize that these slightly below or above average genetic traits have little direct effect upon rule, and if they are hidden by the game rule, there won't be surprises that are actually important to your character when you're looking at modifier breakdowns.
			Ruler-designed characters:
				Rulers are now guarded against any genetic trait modifications.
				If a spouse is selected in the Ruler Designer, they will be subject to standard birth chances of genetic traits. 
				If a spouse and children are selected in the Ruler Designer, the children will undergo genetic inheritance as if they'd been properly born.
				If children but no spouse are selected in the Ruler Designer, the children will only be subject to standard birth chances of genetic traits (cannot inherit genetics from designed ruler without a spouse).
				Ruler-designed rulers, spouses, and children will undergo genetic processing immediately on game initialization rather than potentially getting a random distribution of genetic traits after a delay (where applicable).
			When an AI Duke- or higher-tier ruler marries a lowborn in a barn (i.e., the AI's last-ditch effort to gain any spouse whatsoever), the genes (note: not their own traits but their *genes*) of the newly-wed spouse are now reset to be only either neutral or positive. This will, on net, improve genetic outcomes for the couple's offspring. This measure partially compensates, in this extreme case, for the fact that the marriage AI has no way to prefer avoiding spouses with terrible genes.
		Holy War (Religious Subjugation):
			In the prior version, we introduced an inheritance block for those subjugated via holy war upon any external-realm titles held by a ruler of their prior religion group before they were force-converted. The block only applied when the would-be inheritor was a ruler (i.e., when there was a risk of titles actually being externally inherited), but we decided that wasn't enough: even an unlanded courtier that was force-converted ideally wouldn't inherit external-realm titles of their prior religion group *simply because cross-religion external inheritance is total yuck*. Now, the inheritance block applies to non-rulers too.
			For any that might have been confused by the fact that you still receive Vassal Inheritance Warning alerts regarding rulers that, in the UI, apparently are heir to titles that the external-realm, prior-religion-group inheritance prevention mechanic blocks them from inheriting, note that due to technical limitations with CKII succession, the inheritance can only be blocked at the very last moment before death of the external-realm ruler. Ergo, those alerts will still show despite not mattering in practice whatsoever, unfortunately.
		Imperial Decay:
			Being granted or otherwise gaining (i.e., not inheriting or usurping) an empire title no longer causes any gain in decay.
			Usurping an empire title now causes much, much less decay gain than it would've previously. While a roulette of constant usurpations will still increase decay, a single usurpation will hardly make a dent. A usurpation still implies some "changing of the guard" regarding the imperial bureaucracy (while still contributing to the corruption / at least a temporary loss of efficiency of that bureaucracy), so it is now treated as a more neutral form of title transfer regarding decay.
			Strengthened the effect of an entrenched ruling dynasty upon decay gain due to inheritance (number of consecutive rulers of the same dynasty). This is mostly to give players a bit more challenge continuing to hold on to the imperial crown for many generations, as entrenched as we tend to become. However, it is the dynastic entrenchment's effect upon bureaucratic corruption that matters for this decay component.
			Reversed the effects of *Crown Authority* upon decay gain due to inheritance to make more sense:
				Lower levels now cause less decay gain, while higher levels cause more decay gain.
				Since Imperial Decay is about the tendency toward corruption and overall bureaucratic efficiency over time when unchecked (and not about the authority of the Crown), it makes more sense that a large bureaucracy centralized in the highest tier of the realm's government (higher *Crown Authority*) would have more potential for corruption or reduction in bureaucratic efficiency when that highest tier of the government changes rulers. In contrast, a decentralized bureaucracy in which a number of tiers of the realm's government are all responsible for their share of governance (lower *Crown Authority*) would be less affected by the top tier title changing rulers.
		Seljuks:
			Upon declaring war on the ERE over Anatolia, Seljuks will get 1.05x their levies in event troops instead of 1.63x their levies.
			All Seljuk event troops' reinforce rate are now -75% from normal.
			Toned down the matching troops that a Seljuk invader gains -- while their invasion mission is still active -- significantly.
		The vanilla "You're no longer trait XYZ" events which remove a random personality trait when a character has more than 5 have been disabled for all rulers with the intention of promoting more coherent personalities. Previously, they were only disabled for players in EMF, which has always been greatly appreciated, but now AI *rulers* are also exempt. The landless aren't exempt.
		The 'Request Vassal Transfer' decision and associated events have been updated to:
			Allow any tier of a vassal to request a vassal transfer if they are the most immediate de jure liege of that vassal, regardless of whether the de jure liege title was, e.g., king-tier and the vassal's primary title was count-tier. [Yes, this wasn't possible in vanilla for some reason.]
			Actually instruct AI lieges to respect the "never transfer me" flag set upon vassals whom have achieved independence from their liege rather than simply transfer them right back under that liege after they gain independence.
			Teach AI lieges that it's better to hold on to merchant republic vassals rather than let them go to an underling.
		The AI will is no longer affected by the 3-year cooldown on the "Employ Court Physician" decision to counterbalance the fact that they cannot take traits into account when assigning the Court Physician minor title and don't always assign the title, either. Human players who take over AIs will still be affected by the cooldown if the AI took the decision within 3 years beforehand however.
		Court Maintenance Events:
			The court events which assign random -- and in our opinion, silly -- nicknames to courtiers are now disabled.
			Disabled the event that would randomly upgrade or downgrade a random courtier's skills.
			The events for courtiers randomly getting relations, and courtiers getting random modifiers can all now happen to AI courts.
			All court maintenance events are disabled for human courtiers (should there be any).
			Incapable courtiers should no longer get events where they randomly get relations or modifiers.
			Fixed the logic behind courtiers randomly becoming lovers so that it is now more likely at high opinion instead of being impossible at low opinion, and so that it properly follows attraction patterns (e.g., homosexuals taking on same-sex lovers, celibate and eunuch characters not taking on lovers). Close relatives and *Chaste* characters are also much less likely to become lovers, while *Lustful* and *Hedonist* characters are much more likely to become lovers. Characters that are too old will also not become lovers with characters who are young enough to feasibly have children.
			Tweaked the opinion-based factors for whether two random courtiers become friends or rivals so that there is now a third-tier factor of at least 30 and at most -30 respectively and so that the cutoff for the first tier for becoming rivals is at at most -5 opinion instead of at most 5 opinion.
		Events related to ambitions to improve a stat can now trigger for unlanded characters.
		Unprotected Sex, STDs, and Pregnancy:
			Changed the chances for pregnancy caused by unprotected sex during an event: instead of it being 10% chance multiplied by 2 for each partner that is fertile and multiplied by 0.5 for each partner that is infertile, the chance is now the two partners' fertility multiplied together, divided by 2, and rounded down by up to 2.5%.
			Normalized chances of getting pregnant from the event where a lover comforts a married character to be the same chances as other cases where characters have unprotected sex.
			Normalized chances of getting pregnant from the papal orgy private communion event to be the same chances as other cases where characters have unprotected sex.
			Normalized the chances of getting pregnant from the event for a hedge knight seducing a courtier to be the same chances as other cases where characters have unprotected sex ten times instead of immediately impregnating the seduced courtier.
			All bastards of the pope (Fraticelli or Catholic) will now trigger the Vatican Prince/Princess event unless the mother's spouse thinks the child is his.
			The events for the ancestors steering a character to be lovers with a courtier, steering a character to be friends with a courtier, and steering a character to be rivals with a courtier can no longer create new characters; instead, they will simply never happen if there are no eligible courtiers. The lovers event will also now use the same chances for getting pregnant as other cases where characters have unprotected sex.
			Introduced chance of getting a venereal disease from certain seduction events that involve having sex with an unnamed character and normalized chances of getting pregnant from them to be the same chances as other cases where characters have unprotected sex.
		The events for a hedge knight seducing a courtier and a hedge knight distinguishing themselves can now trigger for AI rulers.
		Modified multiple cases of peasant rebels spawning so that there is a 50% chance of spawning a female rebel peasant leader and so that heresiarchs have a chance to be female depending on their religion and the game's rules.
		*Crown Authority:*
			Reducing *Crown Authority*, whether explicitly or due to a usurpation, no longer adds a cooldown to raising the laws. Only raising *Crown Authority* adds a cooldown. This was the behavior prior to the previous version of EMF.
			Gave the AI some more breaks regarding maintaining higher levels of *Crown Authority* toward the goal of them not always being stuck at either *Autonomous Vassals* or *Limited* for the entire game.
		Patricians / Merchant Republics:
			Merchant Republics now use a different equation for calculating who will be the next doge. Campaign funds contribute 1 per gold to Respect (from 5 per gold in vanilla), Prestige contributes 10 per prestige to Respect (from 2 per prestige in vanilla), Age no longer contributes to Respect (from 1 per its square in years in vanilla), and there is no longer a randomization factor of 500 that can potentially contribute to Respect. This, together with other changes to Merchant Republics and Patricians, should make it much harder to be the eternal, undisputed ruler of a Merchant Republic.
			Newly generated patricians will now spawn with some family palace buildings built. For each family palace building line, they will spawn with it at the level equal to the highest level of that building line in their fellow patricians' family palaces.
			Removed the monthly salary, monthly prestige bonus, and +25 opinion effect for the *Patrician Heir* minor title to balance out the fact that the AI does not grant the minor title to any of its characters. The minor title now cannot be granted to characters with any inheritance blocker (e.g., *Blinded* for the Byzantine culture group and concubines).
			Patricians no longer lose gold when inheriting wealth from their family members. This is meant to eliminate an overly aggressive money sink in the game, which became even more aggressive with split wealth inheritance. It's relatively unnecessary now as well, as there are now way more money sinks available to patricians than in the past.
			Patricians no longer gain prestige based on their treasury. It was kind of wonky that non-patricians wouldn't get prestige from a full treasury when patricians did. Besides, there are now way more places to spend excess money to generate prestige (e.g. Great Works).
			Non-doge patricians now always have a seat reserved for them on their liege's council. This spot will usually be automatically be occupied when a patrician becomes eligible, but will still sometimes require the doge's input for a seat to get occupied.
			The merchant republic-specific minor titles *State Inquisitor*, *High Admiral*, and *High Judge* can no longer be granted to unlanded members of the ruler's dynasty.
		Nerfed the *Recent Succession* malus to no longer include demesne levy, demesne tax, or vassal opinion modifier components. Additionally, the "maximum liege levy" malus is now smaller than the "minimum liege levy" malus.
		Messalian decision to *Castrate Yourself* now only gives 1% religious authority for 1 year rather than 2% for 10 years.
		Adjustments to siege-related building destruction: the post-siege destruction event is now less likely for castle settlements, while the destruction event which occurs on a pulse during but not after a siege is more likely in general if the attacker is religiously hostile to the defender.
		The Pope will no longer ask for very extensive lands/vassals in Italy in exchange for coronation.
		The Great Work upgrades Armory, Studded Bastions, Soaring Fortresses, Gatehouse Forts, and Killing Fields no longer give flat amounts of troops to all holdings in the province in which they are built. Instead, they give a % bonus to the levies of all holdings in the province in which they are built; Armory, Soaring Fortresses, and Gatehouse Forts give +10%, Studded Bastions gives +12.5%, and Killing Fields gives +7.5%.
		When a character with one of the relatively new vanilla ascetic traits (*Muni*, *Aryika*, *Bhikkhu*, *Bhikkuni*, *Sanyasi*, and *Sanyasini*) somehow gains a title, those ascetic traits will be cleared just as we already cleanup after ascetics with the traits *Monk*, *Nun*, *Desert Father*, and *Desert Mother*.
		When a feudal/imperial, tribal, or nomadic ruler dies with a lower-tier heir whom is a ruler with a government type in the theocracy or republic groups, the heir will first abdicate and adopt the correct government type before succeeding their predecessor.
		Independence Faction:
			The faction can now target non-independent lieges (vassal dukes & vassal kings), whereas it's previously only been available against independent lieges.
			Vassals whose capital is distant from their liege's capital will now be more aggressive than previously, taking into account larger distances as well.
			Vassals with the same religion and culture group but not the same specific culture as their liege are now less aggressive at relatively short distances from the liege's capital.
			The direct heir of the liege (whom is not necessarily the heir to the liege's primary title but the character that will inherit their dynastic holdings) will no longer participate in the faction, just as the primary heir (i.e., the heir to the liege's primary title) of the liege will not participate.
			For faction creation/join chance modifiers regarding wrong-religion lieges, it's now required that the liege's religion actually be hostile to the vassal's. E.g., Orthodox Christianity is not hostile to Apostolic Christianity, so those [Armenian] vassals in the Byzantine Empire won't desire independence simply because the Emperor is Orthodox and they're Apostolic.
				Due to the move toward considering religious hostility instead of simple religion or religion group mismatch, vassals with hostile heresies / parent religions within the same religion group as the liege now actually care about independence too.
			Tribal vassals now care even less about whether their primary title is a de jure vassal of the liege, for the purposes of dissuading them from desiring independence.
			Lieges that are also religious heads (e.g., Caliphs) are no longer treated less aggressively by their vassals following their religion.
			Vassals whose subrealm is entirely disconnected from the liege's capital now much more aggressively seek independence; not being connected by at least a seazone either is even worse.
		Claimant Faction:
			When a claimant faction forms in support of a ruler and prepares to send its ultimatum to their liege, the claimant will now have the additional choices to join the faction (if same liege) with them at the last minute or tell the faction to stand down, which will prevent any more claimant factions forming supporting them for the title that they did for 5 years. Previously, there was no agency over this -- sometimes you don't want to be installed as, e.g., the Emperor -- or at least not for now.
		When an AI Duke- or higher-tier ruler marries a lowborn in a barn (i.e., the AI's last-ditch effort to gain any spouse whatsoever), if the lowborn spouse doesn't have the same religion as the ruler and the ruler is AI, she/he will convert to the ruler's religion.
		The piety cost for the *Request Excommunication* diplo-interaction has changed by +500% to 150 piety from the vanilla value of 25 piety.
		*Elective Monarchy* and *Princely Elective* Succession:
			Pretenders to lower-tier titles whose succession is determined by a higher-tier title with *Elective Monarchy* or *Princely Elective* succession law will no longer get extra [weak] claims upon those lower-tier titles -- only the highest-tier title(s).
			When changing the succession law of the HRE, *Elective Monarchy* Succession is now a valid choice like all the others (provided the relatively stringent requirements for changing away from *Princely Elective* are met).
			*Elective Monarchy* now gives a vassal limit bonus of +10. *Princely Elective* already gives +20.
			[SWMH] In the German HRE's electorate setup, the Duchy of Westfranken instead of the Titular Duchy of Franken is now an elector title.
		*Protected Council Appointments:*
			The law is now the default for merchant republics.
			Glory Hound and Moneymaker council positions will no longer have pre-defined positions on passing or repealing the law if they are not powerful vassals.
		The following events can now trigger for AI characters:
			Soldier Distinguishes himself.
			A courtier initiates romance with another courtier (for Counts and Baron-tier patricians)
			A famous herald proposed his service
			Religious Subjugation (Take Province effect)
			Gopher Maid
			Howling at the Moon
			Rats in the walls
			Something in the well
			Tomb Raiding
			A law against the killing of cats
			Meeting other crusaders
			The little group of faithful
			Meeting a Holy Order
			Nail in the Iron Cross
			The HRE crown and the prince.
			Dice-throwing: Warrior Lodge Member is offered chance to start.
			Rowdy Troops demand a greater share of the loot or they will leave. (Negotiation effects)
			Find Commander (for Barons)
			Sends rumors (about artifact, for Counts and Baron-tier patricians)
			Inherited ingredients - keep or no?
			Spoiled Cargo
			Pirates Attack Ships
			Pirates Captured
			Valuable Spice Obtained
			New Markets Discovered
			Lost Ship Appears
			Dockworkers Strike
			Warehouse Fire
			Efficient Dockworkers
			Treasure Found!
			Improved Charts
			Captain Rams Pier
			Hindu ascetic comes to visit
			Buddhist ascetic comes to visit
			Jain ascetic comes to visit
			Diamond is found
			Thugs
			Peasants need elephants for clearing forest
			Crazed elephant runs amuck
			Temple elephants are dying
			Hears of levitating yogi
			The Polos arrive
			Greek troops not wanting to cross the Indus
			Kung fu monks
			U-boat up the Indus
			Visit Nalanda University?
			Visit the Ganges?
			Local Hindu temple asks for donations
			Buddhist or Jain monks ask for donations
			Non-Indian merchants upset about naked Jain ascetics
			Commerce with relics
			Visit Mount Athos?
			Chaste Positive (create character)
			Zealous positive - Muslim: Start
			Poet: Gain diplomacy
			Hunchback: of Notre Dame
		Added many script optimizations (i.e., performance enhancements) related to EMF's religion & heresy modules (to our knowledge, this is/was the second largest resource hog in EMF after the 4-interest faction system).
		Since you're playing a mod that obviously changes the checksum and thus you cannot earn achievements anyway, the text warning you about a particular game rule setting disabling achievements has been disabled (i.e., "This setting disables achievements!").
		When a vassal king whose kingdom is a de jure vassal of his liege's empire, the vassal kingdom's crown laws are locked to that of the empire. If such a vassal king were to create a kingdom that is *outside* the de jure empire (and thus can have its own crown laws), you'd expect that the crown laws on their primary kingdom title (those of the empire) would be copied to the newly-created kingdom, because that's just how title creation works. In vanilla, it does not. Even if the empire and thus the vassal king's primary title at time of kingdom creation had *Absolute Crown Authority*, e.g., the newly-created crown law kingdom will still start at *Autonomous Vassals* -- copying its laws from no title at all.
			Now, in EMF, the crown laws of the de jure vassal king's primary kingdom -- locked to the imperial crown laws -- will always be copied to the newly-created title. Essentially, the relevant laws of the empire title are copied to the new title instead of no laws at all.
		Lucky rulers (which never appear without the player's say-so -- not to be confused with EU4's concept of it) now have +40 combat skill instead of the the +6 which they had previously, a value from the days before personal combat skill was scaled 10x with the release of *Holy Fury*.
		Characters following religions of the Muslim religious group no longer trigger religious outrage when going down the heliocentrism event chain of Scholarship focus.
		Emperor advisors will now give the same amount of prestige (instead of one Advisor giving 0.75 prestige per month and the other giving 1.0 prestige per month).
		The *Sickly* infant trait now gives a higher health malus.
	*FIXES:*
		Fixed issues where the following artifacts would sometimes not spawn properly:
			Iron Crown of Lombardy
			Crown of Thorns
			Seamless Robe of Jesus
			Cloak of Mohammad
			Right Hand of St. Demetrius
			Buddha's Tooth
		Fixed several traits having asymmetrical opposite trait (i.e., trait exclusivity) relationships. This could've led to unintended pairings of traits on a character.
		Religious Features:
			Enacting the *Imperial Administration* law now follows exactly the same rules for Imperial governments; namely, we now check for the reformed pagan religion feature *Temporal Head* rather than the `norse_pagan_reformed` religion specifically.
			Fixed multiple issues where code was reliant on religion-specific features which would not work properly without Holy Fury enabled.
		Patricians:
			Fixed multiple issues related to EMF & vanilla code that erroneously could or could not trigger for patricians whom only hold a family palace.
			Patrician marriage events will no longer fire if the respective characters' genders did not line up with their own gender laws or the gender laws of their patrician liege.
			Patricians with only Baron-tier titles can now select the *Groom an Heir* ambition if their child is their heir.
		Localised the death reason when a character dies from complications due to their delicate physique.
		[Vanilla Map] When forming the Saint-Empire Romain (western variant of the HRE) and the *Ahistorical Empires* game rule is enabled, the prior de jure territory of the regular/German HRE is now properly transferred to the Empire of Germany instead of behaving as if the game rule was not enabled and leaving no de jure empire in its place.
		When seeking to *Prepare a Coronation Ceremony* as a child, the requirement that the child have an "assertive" trait (*Ambitious*, *Quick*, *Genius*, or *Willful*) is now correct.
		When a liege peacefully accepts an *Independence Faction* ultimatum, no longer will claims on all the faction members' titles be awarded to the liege -- just the *Revassalize* CB, as is already the case in EMF when an independence war is won.
		Fixed an issue where AI characters could not complete the "Civilize a Province" ambition.
		Fixed an issue where Spymasters would not receive monthly prestige from their position when all other council members do.
		The 4-interest factions (e.g., Court, Tradition, etc.) will now never demand that their liege lower *Crown Authority* if their liege's kingdom title's crown laws are actually overridden by a de jure liege imperial crown law title and the liege has no actual control over the crown laws on his kingdom title(s). The regular *Lower Crown Authority* faction already sidestepped this issue properly.
		Added death reason localisation for deaths due to [rare] health complications from the *Tiny* trait.
	*VANILLA FIXES:*
		Fixed issue wherein patrician councillors with only their family palace holding would not be considered rulers and appropriately handled as such by the new CKII v3.1 court events & exodus decision.
		The 'Legitimize Bastard' decision and other legitimization events will no longer have the potential to break dynasty trees by only converting the *living* progeny of the bastard to the legitimate dynasty.
		Fixed an issue where the event for seducing a guard as a woman while in prison would never trigger because focuses are not allowed to be taken for prisoners. Instead, it now requires the Master Seductress trait.
		Fixed issues where certain seduction events between characters would not transfer venereal diseases and male seducers would not be in danger of getting venereal diseases.
		Fixed issues where certain seduction events involving sex with an unnamed character could override pregnancies of already pregnant women.
		Fixed issues where certain coronation-related events that triggered for the Papacy would not trigger for the Fraticelli Papacy.
		Fixed an issue where the event for a hedge knight seducing a courtier would trigger for multiple courtiers and could trigger for homosexual courtiers. Also fixed it not passing on venereal diseases.
		Fixed an issue where the event for the ancestors steering a character to be lovers with a courtier would not pass on venereal diseases.
		Fixed an issue where the event for a brilliant commander appearing would not properly work for Cathar and Messalian characters and an issue where female commanders could not appear for feminist religions other than those with the Matriarchal religious feature.
		Fixed an issue where Business Focus' events could not trigger for patricians with only family palace holdings.
		Fixed an issue where the Feuding Families event chain would never trigger between two AI families or two human-controlled family heads.
		Fixed issues where multiple ongoing Feuding Families event chains in the same republic could cause the feuds to criss-cross and pollute each other's progress (previously only relevant in multiplayer, but now possible in singleplayer now that AI-AI feuds are allowed).
		Fixed an issue where the events to end the Feuding Families event chains (Romeo and Juliet, The Battle) could only trigger once, even if the character decides to continue the feud with the family.
		Fixed an issue where progressing down the Feuding Families event chain once would prevent a character from progressing down it a second time.
		The *Ducal Conquest* CB (i.e., Ducal County Conquest), a Jade Dragon CB not to be confused with EMF's *De Jure Duchy Claim* CB, can no longer be used against your own liege.
		Fixed an issue where attempting to swap a councillor to the advisor position as an emperor while having a vassal king with their own advisor would sometimes cause the option to swap places to appear when it should not. This also presents a minor performance improvement.


EMF 10.0 [2019-05-30]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		Split Wealth Inheritance:
			Ruler treasuries are now distributed in a manner similar to Gavelkind when they die.
			The direct heir (i.e., not necessarily the heir to the primary title -- which might be elective, e.g. -- but the heir which would appear on a ruler's Character View) and direct progeny that are eligible for inheritance and of the preferred gender for the ruler's succession law (with the exception that bishop nominees under *Free Investiture* also qualify -- as do bastards, ceteris paribus) all receive shares of the dying ruler's treasury:
				The direct heir receives 4 shares.
				Legitimate direct progeny receive 2 shares each. The direct heir does not qualify for an extra 2 shares if they are also in this class; they almost always are with common succession laws.
				Bastard direct progeny receive 1 share each.
			An example:
				A dying ruler under *Agnatic-Cognatic Primogeniture* succession has 700 gold and 4 sons and 3 daughters.
					The 3 daughters are excluded, because the gender succession would need to be *Absolute Cognatic*, *Enatic-Cognatic*, or *Enatic* for them to inherit.
					One of the sons, John, is a priest / landed clergy, and he is Catholic, so he cannot inherit. He is thus excluded too.
					The direct heir, Richard, is also legitimate, direct male progeny (as opposed to somebody else entirely, as it would likely be under, say, *Seniority* succession).
					One of the other sons, William, is a bastard but otherwise would qualify to inherit.
					The remaining son, Edward, is legitimate and can inherit.
					Resulting wealth inheritance:
						There are 7 shares total (4 for Richard, 2 for Edward, and 1 for William the Bastard). Ergo, each share is worth 100 gold (700/7 = 100).
						Richard gets 400 gold (57%).
						Edward gets 200 gold (29%).
						William the Bastard gets 100 gold (14%).
						John the Priest gets 0 gold.
						Daughters get 0 gold.
			As a Muslim, split wealth inheritance rules are slightly different (approximating Mirath, the laws of inheritance in the Qur'an):
				By default, a male primary heir recieves 8 shares; male, non-bastard direct progeny receive 4 shares; male bastard direct progeny receive 2 shares; male parents receive 2 shares; and the male primary spouse receives 2 shares.
				Females will also always get shares, even under *Agnatic Succession*, although they will always receive half the shares that a male would (i.e., 4 if primary heir, 2 if non-bastard direct progeny, 1 if bastard direct progeny, 1 if mother, and 1 if primary wife).
				An example:
					A dying Muslim ruler under *Agnatic Open* succession has 1700 gold and 2 sons, 1 daughter, no living parents, and three wives. The primary heir is the ruler's brother.
						The primary heir, Muhammad, is eligible for split wealth inheritance.
						One of the sons, Abdul, is a bastard but otherwise would qualify to inherit.
						The remaining son, Ibrahim, is legitimate and can inherit.
						The daughter, Fatima, cannot inherit due to gender succession laws being *Agnatic*, but she is still eligible for split wealth inheritance under Mirath.
						The primary wife, Uzma, is eligible for split wealth inheritance under Mirath.
						The 2 non-primary wives are excluded, because they are not primary wives.
						Resulting wealth inheritance:
							There are 17 shares total (8 for Muhammad, 4 for Ibrahim, 2 for Abdul the Bastard, 2 for Fatima, and 1 for Uzma). Ergo, each share is worth 100 gold (1700/17 = 100).
							Muhammad gets 800 gold (47.1%).
							Ibrahim gets 400 gold (23.5%).
							Abdul the Bastard gets 200 gold (11.8%).
							Fatima gets 200 gold (11.8%).
							Uzma gets 100 gold (5.8%).
							Secondary wives get 0 gold.
		Added a titular Baltic empire title ("Balti" by default, "Baltijas" when holder is Latvian/Lettigallish, and "Baltijos" when holder is Lithuanian or Prussian).
			Capital is Vilnius / Aukshayts. In addition to standard empire creation requirements, it requires holding the Kingdom of Lithuania and, on SWMH only, additionally the Kingdom of Livonia.
			Uses dynamic CoA rules based upon culture: by default, it uses CoA derived from Livonia's from SWMH (a black cross on white, in brief), but when held by a Prussian, Lithuanian, or Latvian/Lettigallish ruler, it uses CoA derived from Lithuania's.
			Credit for this suggestion and its details goes to @TheDovahkiin97
	*CHANGES:*
		Chance of a stillbirth has been restored to 3%. Due to complications with the HF Pregnancy Flavor Events not working correctly with stillbirths (vanilla doesn't have them), we had to disable them in the EMF v9.XX / HIP Furry releases.
		Military:
			Vassals now actually pay upkeep when their liege levy is raised (25%). Previously, they did not pay liege levy upkeep.
			Vassals will now get upset more quickly about keeping their levy raised, with an opinion hit every 4 weeks instead of 6 weeks.
			Demesne levy upkeep has been reduced by 15%, at its lowest level in over a year.
			Galley maintenance has been reduced by 33%.
		Added restrictions based on tier for Bogomilist vassals converting to theocracies.
		Childhood traits:
			Curious and Idolizer can now be obtained by Genius children.
			Playful can now be obtained by Lunatic children.
			Strong, Weak, Slow, and Imbecile children can now get Rowdy.
			Curious can no longer upgrade Imbecile and Slow characters to Slow and no trait respectively. It will now add Shrewd in those cases instead.
		AI Education logic:
			The AI will now be more likely to choose education traits that benefit from existing childhood traits and less likely to choose education traits that are hindered by existing childhood traits, especially so if they are rational.
			Nomadic AIs will no longer be more likely to choose Martial education.
			In addition to Nomadic AIs, Tribal AIs and AIs under lieges with Imperial Elective succession are now also more likely to choose Struggle for appropriate characters. Appropriate characters are males if not under Enatic or Enatic-Cognatic succession and females if not under Agnatic or Agnatic-Cognatic succession.
			Males are less likely to get Humility selected for them.
			Patricians and male dynasty members under patricians are more likely to get Thrifty selected for them.
			Female children under AI characters not of a feminist religion are less likely to get Struggle chosen for them.
			AI characters with high rationality are now more likely to choose Duty, Thrifty, and Struggle for children under them, and less likely to choose Etiquette and Pride for children under them.
		The vanilla event wherein courtiers ask for nicknames can no longer trigger on primary heirs.
		Great Works:
			Added a great work in Mecca called the al-Masjid al-Haram (the Great Mosque of Mecca). It is functionally identical to the Great Mosque great work.
			Added a great work in Jülich (Aachen in SWMH) called the Palace of Aachen. It is functionally identical to the Great Palace great work.
		Banishing unlanded courtiers now only seizes 5% of their wealth. Already, banishing landed characters seized 0% of their wealth, as it does in vanilla.
		*Crown Authority:*
			The lifetime / 50 year cooldown upon *raising* CA law now also applies when it is *lowered*.
			If a ruler is a crown law title holder, that title(s) has greater than *Limited Crown Authority*, and then that ruler converts to an unreformed pagan faith, their CA laws and sub-laws are now set back to the limit for unreformed pagans, *Limited Crown Authority*. Had they been unreformed pagans beforehand, they would've never been allowed to raise CA higher in the first place.
				Likewise, if an unreformed pagan inherits, usurps, or otherwise gains a title with more *Crown Authority* than allowed, they'll be knocked back down to *Limited Crown Authority* too.
		Holy War (Religious Subjugation):
			Upon a victorious holy war, all those subjugated -- plus all of their court's dynasty members, close relatives, and great-grandchildren (and some more extended relations) -- are now barred from *any* inheritance of titles from any external-realm ruler of their prior religion group.
				Additionally, this external-realm inheritance-blocking status for the prior religion group will carry on for a full generation of yet-to-be-born progeny of all such subjugated characters, so it's now extremely improbable that conquered titles will be inherited back into their former realm or any other such shenanigans beyond normal external inheritance concerns.
			The event chain's treatment of subjugating rulers whose secret religion is actually that of the conquering holy warrior is now more coherent.
			Tweaked AI scoring of whether to submit to the conversion ultimatum vs. refuse and lose titles so that, in general, there should now be fewer submissions and more refusals, especially if the most heavy-handed / aggressive approach to the holy war ultimatum is taken by the war winner.
		*Tanistry Succession* is now locked to the Celtic culture group OR anybody with a bloodline that specifically enables the law.
		Crown Artifacts:
			Crown artifacts can no longer be activated if their owners have not been coronated.
			Smith events no longer create crowns for characters below king-tier.
		Crusades:
			Reduced the amount of prestige and piety rulers contribute to the Crusade Pot by pledging to the Crusade.
			Only half the actual Crusade Pot will now be distributed to Crusade participants upon victory. This should directly reduce the inflated vanilla prestige/piety/gold distributions.
			It now costs more piety and prestige to use the 'Change Crusade Target' diplo-action.
	*FIXES:*
		[SWMH] Removed a spurious file which scaled down the on-map models / avatars of various Arabic units. This resulted in midget camel riders, among a few other effects.
		Fixed an exploit wherein, when asking the Pope for a coronation and his request in return is to institute *Papal Investiture* law, rulers could simply change the law back to *Free Investiture* immediately after accepting the Pope's request.
		Fixed an issue introduced in the previous version wherein passing laws via script when no penalty is desired (a penalty might be, e.g., an *Increased Crown Authority* opinion malus and is always at least a cooldown for the major crown laws) still resulted in the penalty being applied.
		Fixed an issue where Danevirke would not have any effect in 867 and 769 starts.
		Merchant republic empires now no longer need to be crowned in order to use the *Lower Imperial Decay* decision.
		Fixed missing great work flavor localization for the Notre Dame.
		The Sicilian-Arabic melting pot will no longer continually try to convert courtiers already of the culture to Sicilian-Arabic.
		Fixed an issue where the Automata Throne great work upgrade could not be built early by imperial governments.
		When an Emperor passes any of the *De Jure Vassal Kingdom Creation* laws, the temporary reaction opinion for realm lords with at least one county within the de jure empire is now properly applied toward the Emperor instead of toward the realm lord's liege (may or may not have been the Emperor).
		"The Poor of Lyon" and "The Council of Saint-Felix" events will now properly display their location in the event title.
		Fixed an issue where vassals could usurp titles off of their incapable liege under Eldership, Princely Elective, and Imperial Elective succession types (when they normally cannot under elective succession types).
		Fixed issues where factions could not go to war over and/or demand reversion of Elective Gavelkind, Eldership, Princely Elective, and Imperial Elective succession laws.
		Fixed an issue where dynasty members could start and/or join factions to instate Feudal Elective succession in realms with Eldership succession.
		Emperor-tier rulers that are subjugated in a holy war will now, in fact, be subjugated.
		Fixed the Gavelkind and Elective Gavelkind descriptions referring to a +30% demesne bonus when the bonus is +50% in EMF.
	*VANILLA FIXES:*
		Fathers will no longer receive the "My concubine is pregnant!" event when they are indeed married to the mother of their recently-conceived child.
		[Vanilla] The potential birth of Sviatoslav I of Kiev is now far more likely, despite the advanced age of his mother Olga.


EMF 9.06 [2019-05-18]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		*Improved Genetics:*
			Integrated and extended the excellent mod **Improved Genetics 2.03 for HIP** by @Crimson9
			Almost all congenital traits are no longer managed by the base game's overly simplistic congenital trait assignment system. Instead, characters will carry and inherit DNA which determines how their genotypes express into phenotypes. Two models of phenotype expression are used: standard Mendelian inheritance for traits that are not on a spectrum (e.g., you are either born with Dwarfism or not) and Polygenic inheritance for traits that are on a spectrum (e.g., Intelligence).
				Subject to Polygenic inheritance:
					Intelligence:
						*Genius*
						*Quick*
						*Bright* (new)
						*Dim* (new)
						*Slow*
						*Imbecile*
					Attractiveness:
						*Attractive*
						*Comely* (new)
						*Homely* (new)
						*Ugly*
					Strength:
						*Strong*
						*Burly* (new)
						*Delicate* (new)
						*Weak*
					Height:
						*Giant*
						*Tall*
						*Short* (new)
						*Tiny* (new)
					Perceptiveness:
						*Perceptive*
						*Absent-Minded*
				Subject to Mendelian inheritance:
					*Clubfooted*
					*Dwarf*
					*Hunchback*
					*Stutter*
					*Lisp*
					*Harelip*
					*Wrymouth*
					*Deaf*
					Health: this is not a trait, but genes for it exist nevertheless, and they affect a character's base level of Health.
			Added coherent random genetic mutation:
				When a character is born, they have a base chance for any given random genetic mutation expressing a trait. This takes precedence over normal genetic inheritance, and since we've made all of the congenital traits managed by the module actually non-congenital and non-random as far as the base game is concerned, when a random mutation occurs, the character's DNA is corrected to properly reflect the mutation so that the underlying genes related to the mutation will be coherently reflected in future generations.
			Umproved the random initialization of genetic traits at campaign startup so as to only affect ahistorical / randomly-generated characters. Also, their assigned congenital traits, if any, will now be able to be seen immediately upon entering the game rather than waiting a few game days.
			Virtually all characters spawned by script will now immediately undergo either random initialization of genetics or, if they have an assigned father / real father and mother, proper birth inheritance and mutation.
			When the base game spawns randomly-generated courtiers after the campaign starts, they will be detected and seeded with appropriate [chances] for genetic traits.
				Additionally, any script that EMF doesn't manage (or vanilla code we haven't noticed yet that does so) which spawns characters will be detected in the same way and undergo proper genetics initialization -- except with a short delay and not immediately as they would've had they been spawned by EMF-managed code.
			Overall, genetics will now be far more coherent within families, and remember, that is a double-edged sword:
				If, say, *Clubfooted* starts popping up in your family more than you're used to seeing it with vanilla "genetics," don't be surprised; that's a lot closer to how real genes express, and apparently you've managed to get some naughty genes in your family (either through an unfortunately well-propogated mutation or through good ol' mating).
				This, of course, also goes for marrying / seducing possibly-great genes into your family based upon the presence of positive traits in mates, so now more than ever, as the CKII loading tip goes, "Pay careful attention to the traits of your wife."
			Notes to modders that want to spawn characters appropriately:
				Use the `emf_new_character` scripted effect after you're done initializing the character. Besides taking care of pagan religious branches, zodiac traits, warrior traits, diplomat traits, and so on, it will initialize the genetics of your character.
					If the character has a living father and a mother, they will automatically go through standard birth inheritance and mutation, so make sure to use `set_father` or `set_real_father` along with `set_mother` before calling `emf_new_character`. If they don't have parents, then their genetics will be assigned randomly according to a realistic trait distribution.
					Any pre-assigned genetic traits will be respected and not altered. E.g., if you set them to be an *Imbecile*, the whole Intelligence spectrum of trait assignment will be skipped.
					To disable any genetic assignment / inheritance / mutation (regardless of whether you use the `emf_new_character` effect), set the flag `emf_dna_check` on the spawned character.
						If you still want to use `emf_new_character` for its other virtues, simply set that flag before invoking it.
			Notes about savegame compatibility:
				Despite adding 8 new congenital traits, this version of EMF is fully save-compatible with all versions in the v9.XX series (i.e., the Furry series of HIP releases that have been released since Holy Fury).
				If you were a user of the Improved Genetics for HIP mod on top of EMF, those savegames will not be compatible with this and future versions of EMF because of a discrepancy in the trait files of Improved Genetics for HIP and actual HIP. Unfortunately, this is unavoidable (or we'd have to break save-compatibility for everyone else).
		Qualify of Life:
			*Transfer De Jure Vassals:*
				This is a new targeted decision that can be taken on vassals whom are the de jure lieges of at least one but possibly many of your other de facto vassals. It will transfer all the correct, de jure vassals to the targeted character with a single click -- opinion bonuses / favors included, as if you had waited for those de jure liege vassals to slowly, if ever, request vassal transfer one at a time. Note that to transfer vassals, as always, the target (i.e., the ruler receiving new vassals), the transferred vassal(s), and yourself must all be at peace and not part of a revolt.
		Game rule: *Liege Culture Conversion:*
			When enabled, AI rulers will sometimes convert to their liege's culture of their own accord. Conversion will happen at a highly-configurable pace. Absolute minimum requirements for a vassal to convert to their liege's culture:
				Vassal is same religion as liege.
				Vassal is a playable ruler (patricians are the only playable rulers that can be below Count-tier -- all rulers above Baron-tier are considered playable); when rulers convert, they will convert any of their unplayable Baron-tier vassals that shared their culture automatically.
				Neither liege nor vassal are part of a revolt.
				If the liege is nomadic, the vassal must also be nomadic.
				The vassal must not consider the liege a 'foe.' Foes include all characters that are rivals, to which they are hostile, and that have committed any [unforgiven] crimes against them.
				The vassal's opinion of their liege must be no less than -20. All negative opinions are much more unlikely for conversion, but this is the minimum.
				Vassal cannot be incapable or a prisoner.
				Vassal's maximum age to be eligible for conversion in this manner is 60 years old.
			Many, many factors have been added to make conversion to lieges' cultures as plausible as possible, including factors such as the following but not limited to:
				Age (greatly in favor at very young ages, not so much at mid-to-old ages)
				Learning skill
				Culture group affinity
				The intelligence spectrum of traits (both genetic and learned) -- dumb vassals over age 6 are pretty difficult to convert this way
				Experience as an *Imperial Guard*, *Imperial Bureaucrat*, or *Imperial Courtier* while still under an empire [They served in the Imperial Court.]
				Whether capital, 1 extra, 2 extra, or all extra demesne provinces match the liege's culture
				Whether the liege and top liege have differing cultures and whether the top liege also differs from the candidate's culture
				Government type affinities: e.g., theocracies are less likely to convert to a non-theocratic liege's culture.
				Similar but much more harsh, "civilized" types of government vassals are *very* unlikely to convert to the culture of an "uncivilized" liege (e.g., a tribal liege to a feudal vassal).
				Opinion of the liege
				Relations to the liege, such as but not limited to:
					Close relatives
					Spouses / Concubinage
					Dynastic Ties
					Friends
					Lovers
					Marriage Ties (a close relative of the liege is married to the vassal)
				Relative power (i.e., troops) to the liege
				Relative title rank to the liege
				Councillors (including Advisers) are much more likely to convert, whilst those that have neither a council position nor so much as a minor title are a bit less likely.
			The game rule has six settings:
				*Slowest* -- 3x slower than Medium (*Slowest* is the default)
				*Slow* -- 2x slower than Medium
				*Medium*
				*Fast* -- 2x faster than Medium
				*Fastest* -- 3x faster than Medium
				*Off*
					The *Off* setting has effectively been the EMF default since EMF's inception, because vanilla has its own "system" for this, added around the same time in which EMF came to being, which we've simply disabled rather than replaced all this time. Why disable the vanilla liege culture conversion? It completely lacks any AI reasoning, any requirements but a prestige cost, or any statistically predictable pacing whatsoever.
			NOTE: This mechanic can only convert vassals to the culture of their *direct liege*. While it does speed up the process a bit if the top liege's culture is also the same as the liege's culture, the top liege (unless also the direct liege) doesn't really matter here. Of course, the top liege will influence all of their direct vassals too.
		No more random dynasty change for Welf Welf or Enrique Trastamara:
			Added workaround for the hard-coded behavior of characters with the *Bastard* trait instantly converting to a new, random dynasty when they have a child for the famous cases of Welf Welf (bastard dynasty of d'Este) and Enrique Trastamara. They and their progeny will now keep their intended dynasty names and coats of arms when they have kids.
	*CHANGES:*
		Buildings:
			Keep buildings now give +0.05 monthly prestige to their liege per level.
			*Gompa Monastery* changes:
				Re-added Gompa Monastery buildings to castle holdings.
				Gompa Monasteries are now alternative versions of the Keep building line that give cultural tech growth modifiers instead of military tech growth modifiers, and they give piety instead of prestige.
				Instead of the requiring their owner to have the Monastic Feudal government type, Gompa Monasteries now require the province in which they are built to have a Tibetan cultural group and either Buddhist, Bön, or Bön Reformed religion. These are the same cultural and religious requirements as the ones to unlock Monastic Feudal, but Gompa Monasteries having cultural and religious requirements instead of government ones fixes a lot of issues, e.g. Gompa Monasteries being buildable outside of the areas in which they should be and Merchant Republics not having access to them.
			*Shipyard* changes:
				Instead of only 2 tiers of shipyards for castles, temples, cities, and tribes being available, there are now 4. This change goes along with another change, reducing galley transport capacity by half (see below under Military / Naval) -- with less transport capacity, we need more galleys.
					For old savegames which started before this version, EMF will auto-build up to the 3rd *Shipyard* tier in all castles, cities, temples, and tribal settlements in the world, up to the level that local province *Shipbuilding* technology level permits. This is to ease the transition and get more galleys available immediately.
				Shipyards cost twice as much to build and now yield more galleys. Cost and build time schedule per tier are identical to vanilla, although EMF shipyards have upkeep.
			[SWMH] Removed the Danevirke unique historical building, which has now been replaced with a Great Wonder.
			Horse Breeder now gives 30 heavy cavalry (from 45). Riding Grounds (the Family Palace building) now gives 15 heavy cavalry (from 0).
			Rebalanced AI priorities for buildings in Castle, Temple, City, Family Palace, and Trade Post holdings. They will now properly prioritize income-providing buildings and properly favor certain levy-providing buildings over others.
		Military:
			The large disparity in warscore worth of occupying the demesne of the attacker/defender in a war vs. occupying their vassals' land (the former being worth more than the latter) has been lessened significantly. They are now worth almost the same. However, occupation of the enemy's demesne is still worth slightly more, and this is largely to encourage the AI to still try to storm the enemy capital sometimes.
			Retinue hire cost (up-front cost -- not reinforcement cost) has changed by +25%.
			Previously, the minimum amount of liege levies which a vassal will provide at the opinion cutoff for providing any at all, 0 opinion, was 33.3%, and as opinion increases from there to 100, it'd linearly scale to 100%. Now, the opinion cutoff is the same, but the min. amount of liege levies provided at 0 opinion is 0%, so for every opinion point, the minimum contribution increases by a percentage point. These are base numbers before law modifiers are applied.
			Naval:
				The number of soldiers which can be transported by a single galley has been halved from 200 to 100 (i.e., the vanilla standard). This motivated adding the additional shipyard building tiers aforementioned.
				Naval attrition (i.e., attrition that troops automatically incur when on a ship rather than land) has been reduced from EMF's prior value of 5% to 3.5%. Vanilla doesn't have naval attrition.
		Made all education traits "opposites" of each other so that the game will automatically remove any other preexisting education trait before adding another via any errant script logic. Aside from being convenient, it prevents some sources of minor vanilla (and possibly EMF, although we strongly doubt it at this juncture) bugs wherein characters will end up with two different education traits at some point.
		The technology spread rate bonus from a trade post being in a province has been increased to 4% (change of +300%).
		The nomad AI will now much more greatly prefer to arrange marriages with other clans in their Khaganate, esp. with their Khagan if a vassal Khan, than seek to arrange marriages outside of their realm with non-nomads.
		Inland trade route income is now more hindered by upstream sieges and especially occupation than previously.
		For government forms that pass laws with prestige, the costs of crown law and demesne law changes has been reduced to the vanilla values.
		Raiding:
			The maximum realm size (i.e., the number of settlements in subrealm) at which AI rulers will raid has been raised to 32 from 24 (change of +33%).
			Raiding frequency / aggression has been slightly increased, although it is still lower than the initial EMF v9.0 / HIP Furry1 release.
		Religion:
			Bishops that favor paying taxes to the Pope instead of their liege (where applicable) will now pay 40% of the taxes that they would've paid to their liege to the Pope instead of only 25%. Net result is that the Pope should have a bit more money.
			*Jizya Tax* modifier:
				Now gives +40% tax instead of +25% tax, because the *Different Religion Group* province modifier already reduces local tax by -20%. This makes holding wrong-religion provinces as a Muslim actually matter in a positive way for their tax income.
				Now gives -20% levy size, since historically, those who paid the Jizya were exempt from military duties.
			Religious Authority (RA):
				RA derived from the religious head's amount of piety (though it is subject to a cap) has been doubled from our previously spartan multiplier. [It's still spartan relative to vanilla.]
				RA derived from the religious head's diplomacy skill level has been increased by +50%. [Again, still spartan relative to vanilla.]
		Muslim Jihad will now never be declared against rulers of other branches of Islam (like Christians, but only not hostile within their religion group for the purposes of Jihad).
		Adjusted weights for council positions:
			Pragmatist, Zealot, Adaptive, and Moneymaker no longer need as high requirements for positive or negative Zeal score in order to trigger appropriate score modifiers (from 100/50/-50/-100 to 40/10/-10/-40)
			The base score for Adaptive was lowered to 50 (from 60).
			Zealot needs a more positive or a more negative Ambition score to trigger the last level of score modifiers (from 30/-30 to 40/-40).
			Glory Hound needs a more positive or a more negative Honor score to trigger the last level of score modifiers (from 20/-20 to 40/-40).
		Wonders:
			Theodosian Walls are now a Great Wonder instead of a a building in Constantinople. They function similar to the Great Walls wonder, but give much higher fort level than the Great Walls wonder. They are at stage 3 out of 4 and come pre-built with 6 appropriate upgrades.
			Added the Danæwirchi wonder to the province of Slesvig. It functions identical to the Great Walls wonder, but is flagged as historical. They are at stage 1 before 968, at stage 2 before 1068 (with 2 upgrades built), at stage 3 before 1170 (with another 2 upgrades built), and at stage 4 afterwards (with another 2 upgrades built).
		Increased mean time to happen (MTTH) for the "Go Native" culture conversion event wherein a ruler converts culture to that of his capital by +50%.
		Under *Imperial Elective* succession, player emperors with the *Strong Basileus* trait only receive +35 electoral vote strength instead of the +100 they previously received. AI emperors with the trait still receive +100 vote strength. Relative to the AI, it's easy enough for players to a) game succession as it is, and b) gain the *Strong Basileus* trait.
		Crown Authority:
			Gave AI rulers a break in prestige requirements/costs for raising Crown Authority laws as well as a slight handicap in maintaining their current tier of the law in the *Lower Crown Authority* faction.
			Increased prestige costs (but not requirements) for players raising Crown Authority.
			*Limited Crown Authority* and higher, which increase vassals' minimum liege levy contribution among other things, now also increase tribal vassals' minimum liege levy contributions.
		Provinces that have only a temple can now prosper through The Reaper's Due's prosperity system.
	*FIXES:*
		Fixed an issue where councillors who lost their job due to going into seclusion or being imprisoned by someone other than their employer would still get the "Fired from Council" modifier.
		Fixed issues where peforming certain actions to commanders to get them to lose their minor title, e.g. imprisoning them or revoking Status of Women laws, would not incur voting power penalties under Imperial Elective succession.
		The Yazidi religion's description no longer makes an incorrect reference to Sunni Islam, which was inherited from vanilla.
		Fixed a bug where the *Employ Priest* decision would not get toggled by the *Show Employment Decisions* decision for tribal characters or characters following religions with autocephaly.
		When the Saint-Empire Romain (i.e., western variant of the "Ottonian HRE") is formed **and** the game rule *Ahistorical Empires* is set to *On*, the de jure empire for the standard/eastern HRE territories will no longer vanish (as if the game rule were set to its default of *Off*) but instead be replaced by the [ahistorical] Empire of Germany.
		Localisation for Byzantine coronations now adapt to possibly being the Roman Empire, or not being Greek.
		Latin Empire can now see Imperial Reconquest tiers via decision, since it can also use the Imperial Reconquest CB.
		Under *Imperial Elective* succession, the tooltip for the emperor's electoral vote strength bonus if they have the *Strong Basileus* trait now properly references the emperor instead of another character.
		Fixed a bug where characters in polygamous marriages could end up accusing themselves of cheating on their spouse lovers and targeting themselves for punishment.
		Fixed an education event bug where the Rowdy trait could end up downgrading genetic traits for intelligence (Genius to Quick, Quick to normal) instead of turning into the Dull trait.
		Fixed an education event bug where the Rowdy trait would sometimes not properly turn into the Uncouth trait.
		Fixed issue where certain devil worshipper events could end up downgrading genetic traits for intelligence (Genius to Quick, Quick to normal, Slow to Imbecile) instead of downgrading acquired traits for intelligence (Shrewd to normal, normal to Dull).
		[Vanilla] Preexisting Jerusalem at the start of a campaign (i.e., not dynamically created after a Crusade) will now have proper *High Crown Authority* and *Protected Inheritance*.
		References to favorite alcohol being drunk will now properly display "Wine" instead of "Beer" for those in the Magyar cultural group and those in the Italian cultural group (SWMH).


EMF 9.05 [2019-04-23]
	*FIXES:*
		Fixed issues with certain cultural castle and cultural tribal buildings not properly giving special troop types.


EMF 9.04 [2019-04-22]
	*CHANGES:*
		*Construction* tech now only gives -3% build cost and -3% build time modifiers per level instead of -4% and -4% per level, respectively.
		Graphics:
			On-map "cornucopia" models for province Prosperity (from *The Reaper's Due* DLC) have been reduced in scale by -60%. No more popcorn covering your entire realm!
			On-map floating disease meshes for epidemics have been reduced in scale by -25%. Similarly, the "Depopulated" grave stone icon has also been reduced in scale by -25%.
		AI characters will no longer go bankrupt requesting baptisms for their children.
	*FIXES:*
		Fixed issues with the Romanization modifiers that prevented them from properly being applied.
		Fixed an issue where the option to avoid negative traits for warrior lodge members from the PTSD event chain would not appear properly.


EMF 9.03 [2019-04-15]
	*CHANGES:*
		Compatibility patch for CKII v3.1 (Great Works).
			Savegames from prior EMF versions in the v9.XX series, pre-3.1, are fully save-compatible despite Paradox changing trait definition order.
		EMF game rules no longer have any settings which warn of disabling achievements; they're already disabled due to the nature of using this mod. Vanilla game rules have been left as-is, however.
		Roman Empire:
			Byzantine Crown is now active after restoring the Roman Empire, and rulers of a restored Roman Empire will use and inherit the old Byzantine Crown.
			Rulers of a restored Roman Empire can now renounce Iconoclasm and suppress Paulicians and events related to those events can now still trigger under a restored Roman Empire.
			Hashshashins can now murder courtiers of a restored Roman Empire, not just of Byzantium.
			Rulers of a restored Roman Empire following Imperial Elective succession will now properly take Born in the Purple, body disfigurement, and child age into account.
		Holy Roman Empire (French / Western HRE & German / Eastern HRE):
			The Pope is now willing to ask for Italian lands and/or Papal Investiture in exchange for coronation of the holder of a French HRE.
			The *Lower Crown Authority* faction is now just as aggressive in a French HRE as it is in the German HRE.
			The AI Hansa can now form under the French HRE if they own the appropriate provinces. Players could already form the Hansa for both variants of the HRE.
			Restoring the Roman Empire will now also cause a prestige loss for the Emperor of a French HRE -- not just the German HRE.
			Upon restoration of the HRE from the TOG/867 bookmark:
				*Princely Elective* succession is now mandatory for players. Previously, only the AI was forced into *Princely Elective* (or *Feudal Elective* before CKII v3.0).
				Certain kingdoms, if held, will now be destroyed in addition to the de jure vassal kingdoms of the empire that were previously auto-destroyed upon formation. This prevents silliness with diverging succession laws within the newly-founded Empire.
					For the German HRE: Italy, Burgundy
					For the French HRE: Italy
		Jewish Court Physicians generated via the Search for Court Physician decision will now always spawn with a trait that marks them as a good physician. This compensates for the fix where belonging to the Jewish religious group no longer is enough to mark a character as a good physician.
		Female characters who can lead commanders can now take part in physical competitions in festivals regardless of other conditions.
		Legalism Technology Tweaks:
			*High Tribal Obligations* is now unlocked at Legalism level 3.
			*Harsh Tribal Obligations* is now unlocked at Legalism level 5.
			*Internal King's Peace* is now unlocked at Legalism level 4.
			*Complete King's Peace* is now unlocked at Legalism level 6.
			*Absolute Demesne Centralization* is now unlocked at Legalism level 8.
		The temporary, annually decaying 5-year *Recent Succession* modifier, which is applied upon ascension to a duke- or higher-tier title via inheritance, now also slightly affects demesne tax income, vassal opinion, and demesne levy availability in addition to the previous effects upon vassals' liege levy contribution.
		The decision *Create Bosnia* now allows king-tier rulers to enact it, so long as their held kingdom(s) are titular.
		All AI patricians may now declare wars against other AI merchant republics which, if victorious, may destroy the enemy merchant republic. Previously, only AI Doge were allowed to do so. Note that players are always allowed to do this, but there are restrictions on non-republic AIs targeting AI merchant republics in ways that might destroy the latter permanently.
		The EMF decision *Renounce Celibacy* is now available to any historical player ruler that started the game with the *Celibate* trait for the first year of your campaign. It allows you to remove the trait at no cost and without any restrictions (beyond the aforementioned time limit). Players can now experience starting with celibate historical characters, had they chosen to give up their celibacy, without a successful succession being virtually impossible.
	*FIXES:*
		[SWMH] The final event in the event chain behind the struggle between the Papacy and the HRE now properly changes the de facto liege of vassals in the Italian *culture group* in Italy.
		If new titles flagged as the Roman Empire are added via submod (beyond Byzantium and Roman Empire), events related to reclaiming lost provinces will now properly trigger for them.
		If new Imperial government types are added via submod, existing feudal governments will properly consider it when determining government potential.
		Addressed a *possible* issue with various EMF events that *might have* caused them to fail to trigger when they should've (could have touched upon aspects of claimant adventurers, decadence, Bema feasts, non-HF coronations, peacock feasts, Isma'ili Rising, Desert Father/Mother migration, Messalian prayer, temple building among tribes, imperial courtiers, Magyar clan land requests, sterility, religious revolts, Seljuk invasion, and all types of grand tournaments / war games).
		Fixed issues where female characters could or could not duel with someone under the conditions of certain events when they would be able to duel with them under Warrior Lodge events' conditions.
		Fixed issues where Zikri, Mahdiyya, Nabawiyya, Kharijite, Haruri, Qarmatian, Adoptionist, Arian, Catholic, Ibadi, Norse, Jewish, Samaritan, Karaite, Zoroastrian, Mazdaki, Zurvanist, Mandaean, Khurmazta, Sunni, Ismail'i, Manichean, Messalian, Miaphysite, Tengri, West African, Slavic, Baltic, Finnish, Aztec, Hindu, Buddhist, Bön, Jain, Zun, and Hellenic characters were unable to send characters to join the following holy orders should they be active: Livonian Brothers of the Sword, Hashshashin, Bektashi Order, Haruriyyah, Jomsvikings, Zealots, Immortals, Arsiyah, Saqaliba, Army of Light, Army of Lucifer, Knights of Saint Mark, Sky Lords, Spirit Guardians, Warriors of Perun, Chosen of Perkunas, Sons of Kaleva, Huitzilopochtli, Followers of Arjuna, Ashoka's Chosen, Dralha's Children, Bulls of Rishabha, Zun Warriors, and Myrmidons.
		Fixed a minor issue where a character kidnapping a vassal did not properly influence the AI's willingness to target said character with a kidnapping plot.
		Fixed issues with uncivilized duel opinion modifiers being applied when dueling women who could actually be considered as warriors (e.g. shieldmaidens, duelists).
		Fixed an issue where only one character in a duel between close relatives needed to have a Divine Blood religion for the duel to be flagged as being able to spark a romance.
		The *Recent Succession* modifier that temporarily weakens any newly-ascended ruler (via standard inheritance) now works properly. The old method used to apply the negative modifiers and decay them annually was no longer working, which resulted in no actual malus after the first year.
		[SWMH] When enacting the *Create Swiss Confederacy* decision, the de jure kingdom of the newly-created de jure Duchy of Switzerland is now correctly set to whatever was the de jure kingdom of the County of Schwyz, rather than having no de jure liege title.
		[Vanilla] Manichean religion no longer has too many holy sites defined, so Manichean players will no longer crash the game when opening their Religion window.
		Child of Destiny rulers can now use the *Tribal Invasion* CB (a catch-all de jure kingdom-tier invasion CB that also gains all occupied titles) an unlimited number of times. Mercenaries also no longer receive a lifetime cooldown; they use this CB when they decide to turn against their employer due to non-payment.
		A number of cases wherein claims are transferred from one title to another (e.g., when forming a special title such as the HRE, claims upon auto-destroyed kingdoms are transferred to the new title) were incorrectly copying claim strength (i.e., weak, weak + pressed, strong, or strong + pressed); those cases have been fixed.
		Following a siege, if the siege unit's owner chooses the 'None of this rabble deserves to live.' option (i.e., executing their captured enemies rather than imprisoning them or simply letting them all go free) and among those executed are kin to the siege unit owner, the appropriate kinslayer trait(s) will now be applied correctly to the siege unit owner rather than in the reverse direction to those being executed.
	*VANILLA FIXES:*
		Fixed an issue where all Jewish physicians would count as good physicians.
		Fixed a localization issue where a tooltip referencing having a tier 4 education trait would appear for the condition of having a tier 3 education trait.
		Fixed an issue that prevented women from being sent to matriarchal holy orders, that allowed men to be sent to matriarchal holy orders, and that prevented women from being sent to holy orders with feminist religions.
		Fixed issues where many spawned characters (e.g. revolt reinforcement commanders, debutantes, randomly generated commanders) did not get relevant traits assigned on creation (e.g. zodiac traits for Hellenics, diplomat and fighter traits) or got assigned traits that they shouldn't have (e.g. caste traits for non-Hindus under certain circumstances).
		Fixed a bug where non-bastard, acknowledged bastard, and legitimized bastard children with the Conclave DLC enabled would only inherit stats from their mother instead of inheriting from both their mother and their father.
		The *Tribal Independence* revolt CB, used by unreformed pagans following a baptism & mass conversion by their liege in order to break free, now actually sets the rebels independent upon success (vassalizing those that can be to the revolt leader) and, instead of granting the former liege claims on all of their titles, it will only give the former liege a rightful subjugation reason (i.e., a *Revassalize* CB) upon the newly-independent rebels.


EMF 9.02 [2019-03-29]
	*CHANGES:*
		The game rule *Historical Outcome Promotion* has been simplified due largely to user confusion over its settings. It now only has 2 settings, *Default* and *Passive*. The old setting of *Aggressive* is now just part of *Default* (they were very similar), while *Passive* remains the same (a number of historical events & mechanics will be disabled -- a sandbox, relatively speaking).
		Governments:
			Nomadic governments no longer enjoy a forced vassal contract with all vassals of other government types. This means that their vassals will provide liege levies and taxes subject to their opinion of their nomadic liege rather than as if their liege opinion was always at its maximum.
			Tribal vassals of merchant republics, republics, theocracies, and holy orders no longer contribute to their vassal limits.
			Holy order governments can no longer build tribal holdings, but they can now change their capital.
		Succession Laws:
			The +5 vassal opinion from *Gavelkind* has been moved to *Elective Gavelkind* to line up with other elective succession law opinion modifiers.
			Historical female characters will no longer start the game with titles that have *Agnatic* succession. Unless following a religion with *Equal* or *Bön* features, they will now start the game with *Agnatic-Cognatic* succession.
			Holy orders and their vassals belonging to religions with *Equal* or *Bön* features will now default to *Absolute Cognatic* succession instead of *Agnatic* succession.
			Unreformed Aztec religion no longer disables early access to *Agnatic-Cognatic* and *Absolute Cognatic* succession unless it spawns with the *Patriarchal* religious feature.
			If gender laws are enabled for merchant republics through modding, they can now properly change gender succession laws to *Agnatic-Cognatic* and *Absolute Cognatic* under appropriate conditions.
		Events:
			The "Death" character from the "Chess with Death" event chain can no longer be imprisoned.
			The event "Try to divorce spouse" can now trigger for all religions-- not just Catholics. The outcome for the religious head interfering can only happen for religions with religious heads, however, and will not trigger if the character trying to divorce their spouse is the religious head.
			Eastern Roman Empire:
				The "Tzykanion" event chain can now fire for (merchant) republic characters and female characters under the proper conditions.
				The "The Varangian and the Princess" event chain now targets an existing courtier of the Varangian Guard instead of spawning a new character. This character will always become lovers with the emperor's/empress' child, and choosing the execution option will now actually execute the Varangian character.
			Patricians:
				Added an event where a patrician family member marries one of their lovers as an alternative to the other patrician family marriage events.
				The event where a patrician family member marries a foreign character can now trigger for Manden characters, and will now generate a Manden, Hindustani, or Irish character depending on the patrician's culture and what they would consider foreign.
			The following event chains can now trigger for AI characters:
				*The Drunken Varangians*
				*Greek Fire*
				*The Varangian and The Princesss*
				*Hippodrome Riots*
				*Tzykanion*
				*The Eunuch Merchant*
				*Hippodrome Sabotage*
				*Hippodrome Races*
				*Völva Appears*
				[viking looting events]
		Factions:
			*Antiking* factions can now form under tribal rulers.
			The *Increase Council Power* faction can now form under Count-tier rulers.
			The *Institute Gavelkind Succession* faction is no longer available under a liege with *Elective Gavelkind* succession.
			Republics and theocracies can now lead the *Lower Crown Authority* faction.
			The AI's willingness to join the following factions is now based upon their total "ai_ambition" personality score rather than simply the traits *Ambitious* and *Content*:
				*Independence*
				*Support Claimant*
				*Overthrow Weak Khan*
				*Increase Council Power*
				*Lower Crown Authority*
				*Institute Seniority Succession*
				*Institute Primogeniture Succession*
				*Institute Gavelkind Succession*
				*Institute Elective Succession*
		Plots:
			Attempted kidnapping of a vassal now also gives a valid reason for the liege to banish the attempted kidnapper.
			Republics, patricians, and theocracies can now take part in *Gain Vassal's Title*, *Gain Liege's Title*, and *Gain Fellow Vassal's Title* plots, as long as the target title is not a primary merchant republic title or a family palace holding.
			The *Seize Trade Post* plot can now also be used by rulers with a trade post connected to the target trade post through a neighboring sea zone.
			The AI's willingness to engage in the following plots is now based upon their total "ai_ambition" personality score rather than simply the traits *Ambitious* and *Content*:
				*Seize Trade Post*
				*Gain Title*
				*Gain Vassal Title*
				*Kill Character*
				*Kill Spouse*
				*Claim Liege Title*
				*Claim Fellow Vassal Title*
				*Discredit Councillor*
				*Embezzle from Liege*
				*Fabricate Heresy*
				*Fabricate Treason*
				*Usurp Incapable Liege*
				*Kidnap Character*
				*Overthrow Empire*
				*Replace Regent*
		Halved the PCS (Personal Combat Skill) bonuses from:
			The tiered combat / fighter / warrior traits
			Martial education traits and intrigue education traits
		Command/Leader Traits:
			The *Winter Soldier* trait now also grants a terrain bonus on arctic terrain.
			The *Rough Terrain Leader* trait now also grants a terrain bonus on marsh terrain.
			To get the *Winter Soldier* trait through battle events, the battle now needs to take place either on arctic terrain or in a location with severe winter climate during winter (previously, it just being winter was enough). Having an existing terrain trait also locks the character out of getting *Winter Soldier* through battle events, and having *Winter Soldier* locks the character out of getting other terrain traits through battle events.
			The *Narrow Flank Leader* trait can now additionally be gained from battle events for battles happening on marsh terrain.
			The *Cavalry Leader* trait now also boosts Horse Archer and Camel Cavalry troops.
			Way of Life Terrain Leader Trait (Strategist) Event Options:
				*Flat Terrain Leader*, *Rough Terrain Leader*, and *Mountain Terrain Leader* traits now require the character to have the appropriate terrain in the character's demesne or at one of their trade posts.
				*Jungle Rat* can now be taken if the character has a demesne province with jungle terrain or if they have a trade post in jungle terrain.
				*Winter Soldier* now requires a demesne or trade post province in either arctic terrain or severe winter climate instead of the old cultural requirements.
				If a character is eligible for more than four terrain leader trait options, they can now choose from all of them instead of just the first four that appear in the list.
		Patricians:
			AI patricians that are below Duke-tier will now preemptively take the *Employ Court Physician* decision.
			Baron-tier patricians now have access to council power laws. As barons, they cannot yet benefit from the increased vassal limit which the laws offer (initially), but neither do Count-tier rulers, and they also have access to council power laws.
			Abducting Baron-tier patricians through society decisions now costs the same amount as abducting Counts.
			Patricians with only their family palace holding now count as unlanded for the purposes of selfish council voting patterns.
			The following factions, ambitions, plots, and decisions are now available for Baron-tier patricians:
				*See Realm Prosper*
				*True Believers* (faction)
				*Strengthen Religion*
				*Gain Title*
				*Build a War Chest*
				*Pledge Peace*
				*Issue Declaration of Repentance*
				*Request Council Position* (previously unavailable for AIs)
				*Donate to Liege*
		Imperial courtiers:
			Male characters can no longer serve as imperial courtiers under titles with *Enatic-Cognatic* or *Enatic* succession.
			Characters from theocratic or republican governments can now attempt to become imperial courtiers.
			When a character returns from an imperial court with a bastard child, the child now has a 50% chance of being female (instead of always being male).
			Matrilineally married male characters can no longer attempt to become imperial courtiers.
		Beja, Somali, and Afar cultures now use North African cultural buildings, retinues, and tactics.
		[SWMH] The nomadic population per empty holding slot in provinces whose capital is empty (i.e., shows the "empty grazing land" graphics as the capital barony) has been reduced to 1375 from 1500; it's 1250 without SWMH.
		For TOG/867 starts, the Empire of France can no longer be created during the HRE restoration period (i.e., before 1000 AD or within 40 years of any successful usage of the *Holy Roman Unification* CB) in favor of the potential formation of the Saint-Empire Romain (the western / latin version of the HRE).
		[SWMH] The *Roman Renaissance* and *Embrace Roman Culture* decisions as well as the *Hellenic Resurgence* event now also apply to the entire Italian culture group (vanilla has only one Italian culture).
		Vassal rulers will no longer support claimants for a title that is being currently contested by someone of a different religion or culture group.
	*FIXES:*
		Cathar, Manichean, Bogomilist, and Fraticelli HRE emperors will now properly use HRE-style coronation should their religion end up in a situation where their religious head can crown them.
		Certain factors which affect the selection of the *Loyalist* and *Adaptive* council positions/stances are now working as intended.
		The features of certain religions are no longer displayed out-of-order, with certain features previously being listed before High God, Evil God, and Scripture names and the rest listed afterward.
		Fixed a minor issue that prevented the AI from being about 2.5x more likely to join The Assassins if eligible.
		*Convince to Straighten-Up* (Muslim decadence):
			The targeted decision is now properly visible in the target's diplomacy/decisions right-click menu.
			Female Muslim rulers who are realm-dynasty heads can now take the decision on valid targets.
		Hellenism:
			When restoring the Roman Empire, the emperor will now properly receive the *Hellenic Resurgence* event (wherein they may choose to secretly convert to Hellenism) after two weeks.
			Unreformed Hellenics now have the proper graphical culture specified for their religion.
		Casus Belli:
			The *De Jure County Claim* and *De Jure Duchy Claim* CBs are again properly hidden when the *De Jure Kingdom Claim* CB is available covering the same targets (EMF always shows you only the best de jure claim CB available to you).
			After a dynamic 4th Crusade victory for the Catholics, the [lack of] imperial government form of ex-vassals of the destroyed Byzantine Empire will now be reflected virtually immediately rather than taking up to a year for the imperial government invalidation.
			The *Holy Roman Unification* CB will no longer, in some corner cases, actually destroy and recreate the target kingdom title upon success rather than properly usurping it as if it were a claim war.
				The succession law of the conquered kingdom should now always be preserved rather than sometimes overwritten with the attacker's primary title's succession law. Half the challenge of trying to restore the HRE lies in juggling the succession of numerous held kingdoms -- perhaps with diverging succession laws -- beforehand.
			Fixed a few dynamic text issues in the Religious Subjugation event chain which ensues after any type of victorious ducal-tier holy war.
			The *Independence* CB no longer shows in the diplomatic map mode as a valid CB for use against a ruler's vassals.
		Laws:
			Lowering *Tribal Organization* to *Minimum* now properly also lowers *Demesne Centralization* law.
			All elective-style succession laws now properly enforce *Protected Inheritance* law.
		Characters spawned by the following event chains now get commander traits, zodiac traits, combat traits, and diplomat traits the way all newly spawned characters should in EMF:
			*Introduce Eunuch?*
			*The Eunuch Merchant*
			*The Varangian and the Princess*
			*Greek Fire*
			*Hippodrome Sabotage*
			*"Await the messenger," a letter reads*
			*Power: Invite witch to court*
			All merchant republic dynastic marriage events
		Buildings:
			The events which can cause destruction of building(s) after a siege are again working properly.
			AI will now build *Radhanite Quarter* buildings in trade posts.
			*Radhanite Quarter* buildings in trade posts no longer remain active under rulers whom are not Jewish, Israelite, or Khazar (only such rulers are able to build these in the first place).
			Cultural tribal buildings of non-Germanic cultures (e.g. Breton, Cornish) are no longer errantly called "Germanic Warrior Lodges".
			Added missing localisation / text for Roman tribal cultural buildings.
		Imperial courtiers:
			Matrilineally married female characters could not attempt to become imperial courtiers under the appropriate conditions. Now they can.
			Theocratic or republican empires can now properly accept imperial courtiers.
		Opinion Modifiers:
			The modifiers for murdering a spouse, murdering a character's father, and successful kidnapping of kin no longer give less severe opinion maluses than attempting to do those actions.
			There's now an opinion modifier for kidnapping a vassal; previously there was only one for attempting to kidnap a vassal.
			Modifiers that are supposed to last for life actually only lasted for 83, 100, or 200 years, which made a difference for immortal characters. They now last for 1000 years.
		The *Recently Acquired* province modifier used by the *Grant Recently Acquired Land* decision now uses the correct icon; it was errantly displaying as one of the EMF Weather icons.
		[SWMH] The bookmark *The Seljuks in Baghdad* now is set to the correct date.
		Fixed incorrect event option text for the reaction event to a spying character (using Intrigue focus) failing to inflame a rivalry between two other characters.
		[SWMH] Added missing localisation / text for the melting pot events that transform Oghuz cultural characters into Türkmen and Türkmen into Türk.
	*VANILLA FIXES:*
		Fix for the vanilla hard-coded bug wherein a newborn child will always be of the mother's dynasty if the father dies during her pregnancy, even if their marriage was patrilineal.
		Fixed an issue that would cause the firstborn reaction event to go haywire.
		Localisation / Text:
			The month of July had no localisation.
			Dynamic text for "actor" and "actress" did not return the correct localisation.
			Dynamic text regarding talking about China could return a non-existent string if China is ruled by Mongols.
			Fixed missing descriptions for level 2 and level 3 battlefield-upgraded swords.
			The tooltip for what the mother of a bastard child will think of the father would use the default "Lady" title instead of the proper title of the mother, should she have one.
		The bonus-giving event for destroying a holding as a nomad now triggers properly.
		Religion:
			Fixed an issue with the Papal and Prince-Bishop baptism event outcomes.
			The Bad Papal Saint event wherein the Pope is a lustful, non-homosexual lover of a given character would not trigger properly in some cases.
		Artifacts & Ingredients:
			Spymasters or court chaplains searching for artifacts would get more progress points than intended if they had 12 or more of their job attribute.
			Mercury (the metal) is now properly treated as a *perceived* healthy but, of course, actually unhealthy ingredient.
		Fixed a minor issue in the Kowtow event chain when calculating the odds of a great outcome from an audience with the emperor.
		Legitimizing Bastards:
			AI characters would never legitimize bastard daughters and rarely acknowledge them, even if they belonged to feminist religions or otherwise had gender equality enabled.
			Female characters couldn't legitimize bastards by decision.
			AI characters would sometimes legitimize male bastards by decision under *Enatic Succession*.
		Female children who were not primary heirs could sometimes fail to be sent into hiding, even if the ruler's title had *Absolute Cognatic* or some form of *Enatic* gender succession.
		The event *The Chancellor is after my wife!* would not trigger for female councillors, and it would also ignore the target councillor's and the spouse's sexual attraction gender preferences.
		Spawned characters now properly get (semi-)randomized traits in the following event chains:
			*Introduce Eunuch?* (the eunuch)
			*The Eunuch Merchant* (the eunuch)
			*Greek Fire*
			*Satanic Orgy* (the dwarf)
		The "Tzykanion" event chain can now properly fire under a restored Roman Empire.
		The *Jungle Rat* commander trait did not count as a terrain trait for the purposes of acquiring terrain traits through battle events.
		The "Satanic Orgy" event chain's group sex (random impregnation) outcome could not affect males, would not properly account for homosexual traits, and would not spread venereal diseases.
		Incest Event Chain:
			Now works properly for homosexual characters.
			Celibate and/or eunuch characters can no longer incorrectly participate.
		The following events can now properly trigger for female characters:
			*Chief Qadi and the drunkard*
			*Court Calligrapher is asked to decorate the mosque*
			*Court Calligrapher: Golden Qu'ran*
			*Wife offers advice: Diplomacy* [Husband can now give advice]
			*Wife offers advice: Martial* [Husband can now give advice]
			*Wife offers advice: Stewardship* [Husband can now give advice]
			*Wife offers advice: Intrigue* [Husband can now give advice]
			*Wife offers advice: Learning* [Husband can now give advice]
			*Wife offers advice - Muslim: Learning* [Husbands can now offer advice]
			*Stressed: Diplomacy*
			*Stressed: Martial*
			*Stressed: Intrigue*
			*Stressed: Stewardship*
			*Stressed: Learning*
			*Ruler lashes out in anger to hide internal frustrations*
			*Stressed Muslim: Learning*
			*Dwarf: Tossing!*
			*Ash'ari Liege has Mu'tazila Vassal*
			*Mu'tazila Liege has Ash'ari Vassal*
			*Cynical Ash'ari Considers Mu'tazila*
			*Zealous Mu'tazila Considers Ash'ari*
			*Become friendly with a fellow vassal when both at same location and we got same liege*
			*Save someone's life at the battlefield...  become very good friend.*
			*Become rival with a fellow vassal when both at same location and we got same liege*
			*Wolf hunting - Luparii*
			*Witch!*
			*Dragon!*
			*Falconry*
			*Banquette: Start*
			*Jousting*
			*Tournaments*
			*Festivals*
			*Bard*
			*A Lord Returns to Sing about the Queen of Elfland*
			*Bal des Ardents*
			*Clubfooted: Riding a horse is hard*
			*Imbecile: Forgot pants*
			*Ill, commanding troops not in battle*
			*Suspect of Incest: Child notices you and sister alone in a tower*
			*During normal hunt, gets glimpse of legendary animal*
			*and what happens first...* [after Death of a good son]
			*The Varangian and the Princess*
			*Try to divorce spouse*
			*Having a fosterling in your court has made your wife more eager to have more children of her own*
			[All Dynastic Marriage Events for Merchant Republics]
			*Accuses spouse of poisoning primary heir*
			*Bored wife*
			*Child constantly plays with swords and practices fighting with older men*
			*Boy is spending all his time in the kitchen, risk becoming gluttonous and craven*
			*Irresistable young wench*
		The following events can now properly *target* female characters:
			*Incompetence at work: Chancellor*
			*Incompetence at work: Steward*
			*Incompetence at work: Spymaster*
			*Incompetence at work: Lord Spiritual*
			*Lack of Piety: Any Courtier - Muslim*
			*Incompetence at work: Chief Mufti - Muslim*
			*Cowardliness: Ruler*
			*Cowardliness: Any Courtier*
			*Occultism: Ruler*
			*Occultism: Any Courtier*
			*Suspected of Incest: Any courtier*
			*Suspected of Incest: Target is confronted*
			*Suspected of Incest: Target is blackmailed*
			*Suspected of Incest: Start*
			*Death of a good son*
			*AI Event for Daughter* [after The Varangian and the Princess]
			*Great Hunt* [event chain start]
			*Someone does not like me and keeps picking on me!*
		Fixed various issues with the *Varangian Guard* event chain:
			Fixed an issue where Varangian Guard outcomes would assume that the Eastern Roman Empire would remain Greek and Orthodox. Spouse outcomes will now generate characters with the culture and religion of the Varangian Guard's liege's capital province, and conversion outcomes will now convert the returning character to the religion of the Varangian Guard's liege's capital province.
			The Varangian Guard loot outcome will now properly share the 300 gold between the child and their parent instead of giving all of it to the parent.
			The Varangian Guard PTSD outcome can now properly trigger if the character is and/or becomes Depressed outside of the event chain, and is now also more likely to happen if this is the case.
			The Varangian Guard Greek Love outcome can now properly trigger if the character is and/or becomes a homosexual outside of the event chain, and is now also more likely to happen if this is the case.
			The Varangian Guard blinded and castrated outcome can now properly trigger if the character becomes blinded and/or castrated outside of the event chain. In fact, now if they are blinded and/or castrated already, then that increases the chance for this outcome.
			The "The Varangian and the Princess" event chain from Legacy of Rome will now properly feed into the Varangian Guard event chain: if the Varangian character involved in it marries the emperor's/empress' child, then that will trigger the appropriate event within the Varangian Guard event chain.
			Fixed an issue where Varangian Guard conversion outcomes required that the converted character follow Norse or Norse Reformed religion, and that the parent to which they return be also follow Norse or Norse Reformed religion. Now, the event can fire if the converted character is following any religion in the pagan group, and it will no longer require that the character's parent follow any particular religion (though if the parent follows a religion that is either the same as the character's new religion or a tolerated heresy of it, their reaction will be slightly different).
			The Varangian Guard death in battle outcome will now also trigger if the character dies in battle outside of the event chain. A second version of this outcome has been created where the character dies outside of battle, and the previous passive chance effects from the character being sick, incapable, and/or infirm have been moved over to the second version.
		Fixed an issue where the "Relative demands inheritance due to ambition" event would not trigger for female characters under non-matriarchal religions even if the realm had *Absolute Cognatic* succession. Fixed a similar issue for male characters under matriarchal religions in realms with *Absolute Cognatic* succession.
		Succession Laws:
			Rulers with the *Bön* religious feature may no longer switch their gender succesion law away from *Absolute Cognatic*, as is apparently intended.
			Rulers with *Enatic* or *Enatic-Cognatic* gender succession will now always have matrilineal marriages enabled, provided that the setting of the *Matrilineal Marriages* game rule allows it.
			Changing the gender succession law of a merchant republic title now properly changes the gender succession law of the character's dynastic holdings as well.
			A good commander under a liege with *Imperial Elective* succession who loses their title for reasons outside of their liege's control (e.g., they went into hiding) will no longer cause their liege to incur elective voting power maluses for "firing" good commanders.
		Consorts and lovers of characters whom either caught diseases or were cured of them will now properly trigger relationship omens from scrying.
		Rulers who do not need / qualify for coronation themselves will no longer potentially be envious of others' extravagant coronation ceremonies.
		Plots and Ambitions:
			Rulers with *Ultimogeniture* succession can now take the *Have a Son* ambition.
			Baron-tier AI patricians now properly take certain factors into account when choosing to engage in a kidnapping plot or when taking the *Have a Son* ambition.
		The "Queen Mother takes over regency" and "My friend's friend is my friend" events can now actually trigger properly.
		Bastard males can no longer attempt to make claims against titles with *Enatic* or *Enatic-Cognatic* gender succession without limits.


EMF 9.01 [2019-03-04]
	*CHANGES:*
		The AI will now never declare war, unless forced to do so by script, when it is already involved in any other war, even as an ally.
		*King's Peace:*
			We no longer use the hard-coded king's peace mechanic to implement *Internal King's Peace* and *Complete King's Peace* for more flexibility (and in the future, more fine-grained control of the laws). We already started this process by blocking vassal kings from external realm wars with *Complete King's Peace*; with vanilla and the hard-coded mechanic, vassal kings are exempt from the ban on external wars.
			The behavior of *Internal King's Peace* has changed slightly, so to largely restate it:
				Vassals, direct or indirect, will not be able to declare war upon other vassals, direct or indirect, of their effective crown law title holder (i.e., you) unless they're rebelling against their de facto liege OR the defender is subject to a different crown law title which lacks either the *Internal King's Peace* or *Complete King's Peace* laws. The latter case can occur when you're holding multiple crown law titles with different laws on the matter.
			In the future, we plan to add more law settings to the *King's Peace* law group as well as supporting events and decisions in order to add much more fine-grained strategic control, challenge, and dynamic interactions regarding vassal wars.
		The Varangian Guard's title culture (controls the culture of characters which spawn in its court) is no longer forced to be the same as the first holder in a campaign.
		Holy War (Religious Subjugation):
			It is now permitted for emperor-tier rulers to convert and bend the knee. It's highly unlikely that they'll not have a county within their realm outside of the target duchy, which would make them refuse automatically, but if they indeed do not, emperor-tier attackers can subjugate them (and their empire titles will be destroyed, as in all of the same-tier attacker-defender cases).
			Risk of a religious revolt following such a holy war has now been reduced more significantly for those that choose to take the lightest / most laissez-faire approach to their holy war ultimatum at the end of the war.
			Tweaked the AI reasoning/scoring for choosing to bend the knee vs. refusing and losing their land.
		AI Crusader Kings and Queens will now receive less malus to levy reinforce rate, levy size, garrison size, etc. due to having recently conquered the Crusade target kingdom, and they will receive a non-reinforcing standing army of approximately 5000 men. This should give them a fighting chance at survival for at least awhile.
		Tribal Feudalization:
			When using the *Adopt Feudalism* decision (both independent and as a vassal):
				For every province in your demesne, if it has an empty holding slot, either a city or temple will be built if the province lacks one. If it lacks both types of holdings, then it's a 50% chance of selecting either holding type (but never both).
				For every empty holding slot in your demesne, a [small] regiment of event troops will be spawned for you. They will disband upon succession. This represents the organization of an initial levy from the previously tribal lands and will help make the transition to feudal government less dangerous.
			In an effort to promote AI tribes eventually converting to a "civilized" government form rather than remaining tribal virtually forever: AI tribes, vassal or independent, can now raise *Tribal Organization* law without a prestige cost or 10-year temporary opinion malus if any of the two following conditions apply:
				Their direct liege has adopted such a "civilized" government form (feudal, republican, or theocratic).
				The tribe's independent realm borders a "civilized" ruler either directly or through 1 seazone.
		Balancing the tribal menace introduced by CKII v3.0.X / Holy Fury:
			AI raiding aggression has been reverted to the lesser vanilla setting, as the bug with a sheepish raiding AI was indeed fully fixed with CKII v3.0.X.
			Looter armies (i.e., toggled on as a looter) normally only pay 5% of the regular levy maintenance multiplier; now they pay 10% as in vanilla.
			Tribal holdings' levy reinforcement rate has been reduced to be the same as a castle (still much higher than a temple or a city).
			The base hire cost and maintenance cost of tribal retinues which cost prestige or cost piety (i.e., all of them) have been increased by +33%.
			All tribal retinue unit-type morale bonuses have been removed.
			All tribal retinue unit-type offensive/defensive bonuses have been capped at +30% attack/defense. Affected retinue type stats:
				*Ardent Guardians* archer defense bonus dropped from +40%.
				*Sworn Defenders* light infantry defense bonus dropped from +60% and archer defense bonus dropped from +40%.
				*Tribal Warrior* light infantry defense bonus dropped from +50%.
				*Trapper* light infantry defense bonus dropped from +60% and archer attack bonus dropped from +40%.
				*Hunting Party* light infantry attack bonus dropped from +60%.
		Addressing sometimes widespread debt for AI feudal lords:
			Regular levy maintenance (i.e., for non-looters such as feudal lords) has been reduced by slightly more than -10%. It was very, very high (and still is, for good reason).
			Due to the AI being essentially braindead when it comes to getting out of debt:
				AIs can no longer take loans unless they are a primary participant in a war (i.e., the primary attacker or defender -- not an ally).
				AIs now must meet +10% higher yearly income requirements than required of players for taking out any loan.
				AIs no longer pay the 7-10% yearly interest on their loans that players do (but still pay interest to repay them).
				AIs' heirs will not inherit their predecessors' debts.
		Max nomadic population derived from number of empty holding slots in provinces where the capital is also an empty holding (i.e., not owned by another Count or above) has been reduced to 1250 from 1500 on the vanilla map and to 1500 from 1750 on the SWMH map.
		The maintenance code which ensures that holy orders and religious heads do not get trapped under a wrong-religion liege has been updated to only apply to *landless-type* religious head or holy order titles (i.e., they remain rulers of their primary title even if they're unlanded), and if the religious head / holy order is landed within the realm in which they're trapped, their liege will gain all of their land before they set themselves independent. Consequently, the *Revassalize* CB justification for that liege has been removed.
		Finnish pagan characters can now intermarry with characters following norse, baltic, and slavic pagan faiths.
		Magyar Migration:
			When using the *Feudalize Tribes* day-1 customization decision **and** the game rule *Historical Outcome Promotion* is set to *Aggressive*, the Magyars will now remain tribal so that they can have a chance to advance through their extended event chain to [maybe] migrate to the Carpathian Basin.
			If the game rule *Historical Outcome Promotion* is NOT set to *Passive*, the Magyars will not request a baptism (and thus try to induce a mass conversion) from nearby non-pagan realms until after they've conquered [all of] Hungary or the year 920, whichever comes first. Previously, they were frequently converting to Orthodox / Apostolic / etc. very quickly before having a chance to take their historical path.
		Characters following traditionally feminist religions will no longer get gender-associated opinion maluses when deciding who to vote for in elective succession types.
		When a ruler of a religion which requires the *Strong Basileus* trait to use the *Imperial Reconquest* CB enacts the decision to restore the Byzantine Empire but is already crowned in some other fashion, they will be automatically given the *Strong Basileus* coronation trait so that they may use the aforementioned CB.
		Restoration of Rome:
			The Latin Empire may now also restore the Roman Empire.
			The HRE will be renamed either to Francia or Germania depending upon whether it is the Saint-Empire Romain or the regular Holy Roman Empire, respectively, and all players will be informed of the name change.
			Claims on the previous empire will now be copied to the Roman Empire before the previous empire is destroyed.
		Imperial Government:
			The *Imperial Administration* law, which must be enacted in order to convert to an imperial government type, now also grants +1 demesne limit.
			*Make Title Inheritable* targeted decision, used to make an imperial vassal a normal feudal vassal:
				Now allows player lieges to make other players feudal. Previously, valid targets were only AI viceroys.
				This decision will now never be taken by an AI liege if they have an imperial government form themselves. Previously, only the emperor wouldn't take the decision, which led to AI vassal king viceroys freely flipping their imperial duke-tier viceroys to hereditary feudal governments.
		*Council Laws*:
			Title granting voting and title revocation voting have been combined into a single law called Titles voting. It now also controls transfer vassalage, retract vassalage, Lollard temple revocation, split clan, and absorb clan decisions.
			Imprisonment, banishment, and execution voting have been combined into a single law called Justice voting. It now also controls release prisoner, ransom prisoner, recruit prisoner, move prisoner to oubliette, move prisoner to dungeon, move prisoner to house arrest, blind prisoner, castrate prisoner, Zun Judgment, and Kharijite Public Execution decisions.
			War voting has been renamed to Diplomacy voting and now also controls create NAP, break NAP, create alliance, break alliance, prepare invasion, ask to join war, release tributary, ask for vassalization, release vassal, and offer vassalization decisions. Its Council option is now no longer a prerequisite for other council laws' Council options.
			The Council options of Titles voting, Justice voting, and Diplomacy voting now all grant +5 vassal limit (from +4, +6, and +2 respectively).
			The Ruler option of Law voting now grants -5 vassal limit and only provides +1 demesne limit (from +2).
		Council positions:
			Unhardcoded many of the factors that contribute to the scores of various council positions so that they trigger off of AI behavioral scores instead of discrete traits.
			Added two new council positions: Adaptive and Moneymaker. Adaptive councilors have no pre-determined positions on matters that do not directly affect them. Moneymaker councilors are sort of a combination of Glory Hound and Pragmatist positions, favoring peace but also favoring a strong, centralized realm.
		Council voting behaviors:
			Added in voting behaviors for AIs so that they favor friends and lovers and try to protect them the way they protect family members.
			Added in missing voting behaviors for religion-based laws added by EMF.
			Added in missing voting behaviors for Status of Women laws.
		Adopted children now suffer a smaller penalty, but are less likely to be voted for in elective succession and less likely to have their claim supported by a faction.
		*Imperial Elective* succession now accounts for the current emperor being a *Strong Basileus*, in which case the current emperor has significantly more electoral vote strength.
		Female characters that satisfy certain conditions (e.g. being a duelist, being a shieldmaiden, being a commander, et al.) are now eligible for dueling events and to be targeted by dueling events.
		Shieldmaidens can now request to join the Varangian guard even under non-feminist realms.
		The HRE's de jure capital is no longer fixed in Aachen (or Paris, for the Saint-Empire Romain). Instead, it will move dynamically along with the best county in the emperor's demesne at the time of campaign initialization, formation of any of the HRE variants from earlier starts, and upon every imperial succession. This is much more realistic, and Aachen -- a county which is usually a republic on SWMH and thus due to game quirks will tend to make former, dead Emperors appear as if they had a republic government form if it was their capital -- is simply not an appropriate county to be sought after tyrannically as the de jure capital by every Emperor.
	*FIXES:*
		Three different types of County Conquest CBs -- Pagans' same-religion variant, Muslims' same-religion variant, and Muslims' different-religion variant (i.e., a minor holy war) -- are again available to use as designed. In EMF v9.0, a bug prevented them from being available at all.
		The rare but annoying 'End of an Empire' announcement event spam bug for ex-nomads has finally been solved.
		Holy war CBs using EMF's Religious Subjugation (RelSub) mechanic -- all of the normal de jure ducal tier types -- again correctly allow the vanquished to bend the knee and convert. After patch 3.0.X / HF, a base game bug caused the conquered rulers to be considered "higher tier than" the attacker regardless of actual tier, so this prevented vassalization. An inelegant workaround later, RelSub now functions correctly again.
		Fixed the Varangian Guard's initial courtiers at campaign start having Isis's religion & culture.
		The decision to *Found Holy Roman Empire* from the 769 start or a shattered world start should now work with the game rule *Ahistorical De Jure Empires* set to *Off* (the default when not using an alternate start).
		Fixed being unable to nominate siblings under *Elective Monarchy* and *Princely Elective* succession laws and them being unable to participate in the voting process.
		*Imperial Reconquest*:
			Latin Empire may now use the CB without the war invalidating immediately.
			Hellenic pagans (and their reformed faith) can now use the CB.
		King-tier rulers with *Complete King's Peace* on their crown law title (which they hold themselves) will no longer be blocked from all war declarations as if they were a vassal subject to the crown law.
		Fixed a bug where setting the *Gender Equality* game rule to *Historical* would cause *Status of Women* law considerations to not trigger properly under elective succession types.
		Restoration of Rome:
			Now adds the proper imperial bloodline
			Now has a chance to start a Hellenic revival
				NOTE: AI won't do this even if the *Hellenic Revival* game rule is enabled unless the *Historical Outcome Promotion* game rule is set to *Passive*.
			Now gives the Emperor the opportunity to burn Rome and rebuild it (too many damn temples!)
		Fixed an issue with duel-related combat trait advancement events that could portray your character as having fought themselves.
		Imperial viceroys will no longer flip back to feudal government if they gain a lower-tier feudal title that is exempt from *Imperial Government*.
		Nomads spawned through vanilla's nomad agitation will no longer get married to a newly generated character of the same sex.
		Vanilla nomad agitation events will now only occur if the old holder of the affected province was a nomad.
		Bon pagans' home province modifier is now in line with the rest of the defensive pagan religions.
		Taking the decision to *Form an Empire of the Outremer* now properly works.
		The outrageous odds of a building being destroyed due to a siege have been reverted to our normal, intended chances (a blunder for which you can thank @zijistark -- his desire to burn the world knows no end).
		Fixed issues where certain trait-based events were unavailable to homosexual characters and where certain trait-based events could trigger off of homosexual courtiers despite the root character being of the opposite sex.
		Fixed an issue where a pregnant woman could still get the "envious of characters with children" event.
		Fixed issues where certain trait-based events were unavailable to women or trigger off of women courtiers for arbitrary reasons.
		Fixed an issue where the "The Unusual Duel" event chain would halt halfway because it would not properly trigger the start of the duel once a location was chosen.
		Fixed a minor issue where gardener AI characters would have 4x weight to Show nearby location for stargazing during the Invite Hermetic member to Stargazing event chain. They now have 2x weight if they are a gardener, but also 2x weight if they are a hunter.
		Fixed an issue where female firstborns would not properly trigger reaction events under succession laws where they would inherit a character's primary title, and where male firstborns would trigger the event under Enatic succession law.
		Fixed an issue where ultimogeniture succession sometimes did not properly trigger reaction events for a firstborn.


EMF 9.0 [2019-02-14]
	*CHANGES:*
		Compatibility patch with Crusader Kings II v3.0.1.1
		Theocratic or republican government form will no longer takeover previously feudal/imperial, tribal, or nomadic titles when their ruler abdicates, unless the abdication heir is not of a lower rank than the abdicator. Similarly, in various places where we previously guarded against such takeover of feudal titles, the protection has been extended to tribal and nomadic titles.
		Pagan tribes now [again] no longer need their religion reformed in order to convert to feudalism or found a merchant republic. This is BIG.
		Roman Empire:
			Lombardia (i.e., northern Italy) has been moved from Imperial Reconquest Tier 3 to Tier 4.
			Restoring the Roman Empire now simply requires complete control (at the county level) of Imperial Reconquest Tiers 1 through 3 rather than a random smattering of duchies as it did previously.
		Custom kingdom/empire formation:
			The new EMF game rule *Custom Title Formation* has replaced the Charlemagne DLC's *Custom Realms* game rule.
			The game rule now has a new setting, *Default*, which takes the place of *On*. The default setting is no longer always player-only; if the alternate start setting which disables de jure empires is set, the AI will be able to use the *Form a New Empire* decision too.
			The game rule now has another new setting, *AI Allowed*, which now allows, in addition to players, particularly accomplished AIs to also be able to create custom kingdoms/empires.
			For both *Default* and *AI Allowed*, if the alternate start setting which disables de jure empires is set, the formed titles may, depending upon territorial control, gain de jure territory instantly upon creation.
			For submodders: if instant de jure reassignment of completely controlled duchies/kingdoms to custom kingdoms/empires is desired, look into `events/emf_config.txt` for the relevant global flag settings to enable it (`emf_config_dejure_custom_kingdom_titles` and `emf_config_dejure_custom_empire_titles`).
		Old Norse provinces that might remain in England after 1100 when the English melting pot activates are now considered valid provinces to melt into English as well.
		Casus Belli:
			If you're plotting to kidnap a ruler, you may no longer declare war upon them for the duration of the plot; if you've just cause to declare war upon them and you wish to do so, then leave your intrigue at the door, grab an axe, and cancel that plot. This change resolves a particularly cheesy exploit.
			You may no longer use the *De Jure Claim* CBs (or their third-party variants) against your rightful religious head for a de jure barony, county, duchy, or kingdom which is or contains a holy site of your shared religion. The holy site(s) must actually be in the de facto [sub]realm of the religious head for this restriction to apply. Note that "rightful" religious head refers to your Antipope instead of your Pope when applicable.
			*De Jure Kingdom Claim*:
				No longer requires the defender to be in the same religion group as the attacker.
				No longer requires a realm border within the target kingdom. This is consistent with all of the other *De Jure Claim* CBs; none require a border, only de jure pretension.
			*Nomad Subjugation*:
				Now always requires the attacker to be of a higher tier than the target. [This is not particularly hard to achieve given that the lowest possible rank of a nomad is king-tier.]
				Fixed the lack of an `is_valid` definition in the CB (vanilla bug), which meant there were cases where wars could persist into perpetuity or victory could result in an incoherent outcome.
				Can no longer result in an outcome wherein, if the target holds a religious head title, *all* titles are stripped from the target but the religious head title, and the target simply becomes independent.
			*Pagan Subjugation*:
				Now requires the attacker to be of a higher tier than the target, except in the case where both attacker and defender are duke-tier (counts can't use the CB at all).
				Fixed the lack of an `is_valid` definition in the CB (vanilla bug), which meant there were cases where wars could persist into perpetuity or victory could result in an incoherent outcome.
				Split the CB into two different variants: one for same-religion targets and one for different-religion targets. Different-religion targets will treat it as a holy war and [try to] call-to-arms any neighboring coreligionists to assist with defense. This is partially a balance / challenge measure.
				The CB now costs some prestige to use, which scales from 100 to 500 prestige dependent upon the number of provinces in the target's realm (since they will all be consumed upon victory). The scaling is roughly 25 prestige per province.
				Can no longer result in an outcome wherein, if the target holds a religious head title, *all* titles are stripped from the target but the religious head title, and the target simply becomes independent.
			*Imperial Reconquest*:
				Cannot be used in alternate starts (e.g., Random World).
				Victory will now much more often auto-usurp or auto-create the actual target duchy title rather than only taking the titles under it or vassalizing them.
				The Latin Empire can now use the CB too.
		Random World:
			*Holy Roman Empire*:
				When using the default 'Holy Roman Empire' scenario (tries to create an empire with some of the same characteristics of the HRE), EMF will dynamically, intelligently select de jure elector titles for the empire's Princely Elective succession. In vanilla, the spawned HRE will always use the historical German elector title setup, which is obviously wildly incoherent for an empire that could be anywhere on the map.
				Additionally, it will spawn 3 de jure theocracies within the Alternate HRE (though it's possible some more may be added by the *Minor Theocracies* setting), and it will try to assign up to 3 elector titles to theocracies (preferring archbishops to prince-bishops) before it begins selecting powerful duke-tier elector titles. The theocracies are spawned in such a way that their cultures (which match their local province culture) are varied.
			*Byzantine Empire*: The code for spawning this alternate empire has been dramatically upgraded. Details are ultimately too many to list, but some highlights:
				It's much better than vanilla at actually spawning correctly on the map.
				The religious head of the emperor, if his religion has one, will be vassalized, and if not already landed, granted a temple in the empire capital.
				The empire capital's holding slot capacity will be maximized (note when using the SWMH map: sometimes this still isn't the full 7 slots depending upon where the empire needs to spawn in the random world) and filled with a random-weighted 2:1 ratio of auto-built cities to auto-built castles.
				Unlike vanilla, the Byzantine Emperor doesn't start the game with every single ducal title in the realm in his demesne so that it may be granted as a viceroyalty title. In EMF, the emperor doesn't need to first hold and then grant such a title for it to become viceroyal: all dukes and kings under an emperor with Imperial Government (such as the Byzantine Emperor) are automatically viceroys. We feel this is a bit less gamey and tedious too.
				The Varangian Guard, if starting after the year 911 AD, will be correctly vassalized to the alternate Byzantine Empire.
				In vanilla, the alternate Byzantine Empire usually receives Primogeniture succession, but in EMF, it starts with Imperial Elective.
			Limitations when the de jure setup is randomized (all of these will be addressed in a future EMF release):
				The *Automatic Empire Disintegration* mechanic is disabled.
				Titular title auto-destruction is disabled.
				*Imperial Kingdom Creation* crown laws for preventing vassal dukes from creating kingdoms cannot work in the Random World (until we overhaul how the randomized de jure setup provided by the hard-code works), so it is disabled.
				The *Titular Title Creation* game rule will, in some cases when a random world de jure kingdom or empire becomes titular (e.g., due to de jure drift), fail to stop these titles' creation if so requested by the rule setting. However, blocking titular duchy creation is unaffected.
				Again, we have an [ambitious] plan for eliminating all of these Random World limitations, and we intend to implement it in the next EMF version.
		*History's Forgotten Daughters*:
			This preexisting feature is intended to promote the marriage/alliance game right from the start of the game. HFD will only generate daughters for rulers in cases where they cannot disrupt the existing line of succession. Thus, you won't see historical rulers whom were famously childless suddenly having a few sons and daughters as you would with the vanilla *Generate Families* rule, which we have disabled for this and other reasons.
			It has been significantly improved so that many more daughter-less rulers can safely receive a daughter without affecting succession; now it is much more effective at jumpstarting the marriage/alliance game (particularly in the early bookmarks).
		Combat Tactics:
			Improved the quality of combat tactics graphics so that the icons no longer look like someone fed them through three different compression algorithms, and added sets of combat tactic icons that correspond with camel cavalry, war elephants, and galleys.
			Mameluke Raid tactics will now display camel cavalry icons instead of horse archer ones, and Gray Wall tactics will now display war elephant icons instead of horse archer ones.
			Set up cultural combat tactics, cultural retinues, and cultural castle buildings so that every cultural group has a "default" cultural specialty associated with it. This helps to future-proof the mod in case new cultures are added in the future, and helps integrate other modmods that add new cultures to existing cultural groups.
			The offensive bonuses that horse archers got in Stand Fast tactics have been changed to be archer bonuses instead.
			Missile Harass tactics have had the offensive bonuses they gave to archers moved to light infantry, and they have been renamed "Guerilla Harass" to better represent what the tactics do. This should line up better with the cultural retinues and cultural castle buildings of cultures that have access to this set of combat tactics.
			Flanks without commanders assigned can now use various combat tactics, though they will always get the "bad" versions of whatever tactic gets chosen.
		Buildings:
			Added cultural castle buildings to Roman, Venetian, and Ligurian cultures that are different from the normal, Italian castle cultural building and that line up with their respective cultural combat tactics and cultural retinues.
			The AI will now properly build hospital holdings and buildings in hospital holdings. In general, AI characters will be more likely to build hospital holdings in their demesne, in provinces with active diseases, and/or if they have a lot of money, and non-feudal, non-republic characters will be most likely to build buildings in hospital holdings, then republic characters, then feudal characters.
			*Castle Town V* now has a build time of 2190 days (from 2160 days), which makes it properly line up with how build times scale for all other buildings.
			Added the missing entry for *Stables VI* for castle holdings that is referenced in multiple other places, but did not actually have an entry before.
			Rulers can now only build the Radhanite Quarter special building in trade posts if neither they nor any of their lieges have expelled the Jews. If either a character or any of their lieges expels the Jews at any point, all Radhanite Quarter buildings are deactivated until the situation changes.
		Jews and Loans:
			Decoupled the loan mechanic in EMF from "Jewish moneylenders." The money simply comes from wherever it comes -- nobility, merchants, etc. Consequences:
				Enacting the *Expel The Jewry* decision will no longer clear everybody's loans in the realm automagically. Loans must still be paid by all. [NOTE: In the future, we may add a relative interest rate reduction to realms without expelled Jews.]
				If you (or your top liege!) do *Expel The Jewry*, then you may still take out loans, and so may those rulers under you.
				Since Jews aren't fundamental to loans, all religion groups now have access to the loan decisions: even pagans can now take loans, although they might not be able to meet the yearly income requirements for the larger loans.
			Other changes to the *Expel The Jewry* decision:
				Toned down the amount of gold that can be effectively seized from the theoretical Jews in your realm, and the amount now scales with the number of provinces in your realm (and your own yearly income).
				Slightly increased the prestige cost of taking the decision (cost now scales with your tier too).
				Any of your realm lords with sympathies toward Judaism, that have Jewish family/spouses/betrothals/educators/friends/lovers/concubines, or that have important Jews in their court (i.e., they are councillors or commanders; are well-liked despite the "Infidel" opinion malus; are educating the ruler, their family, or a friend; etc.) will dislike you for the forced expulsion for a period of time.
		Improved internal character liege change tracking for better coherency regarding numerous systems (e.g., civil war loyalist vs. neutral vs. rebel tracking).
		Characters with the *Peasant Leader* trait who gain a title will now have their rebel trait automatically upgraded to *Peasant Ruler* and will be given their own dynasty if they are lowborn. This was already done for religious revolt leaders upon rebellion success -- but only in that case of gaining a landed title.
		AI rulers that are reduced to a barony due to a war or other kind of title transfer but still have count-tier vassals will now automatically revoke an AI vassal's county, preferring their primary title's de jure capital county, not taking titles from rulers with historical dynasties, not taking AI capital counties, and not taking the last county of their AI vassal. Checks for this occur periodically on a pulse as well as at the end of every war.
		Added the *Livonian Brothers of the Sword* Western Christian holy order. Note that this Order is NOT the *Livonian Order*, although it is a precursor to it.
		The *Holy Fury* DLC's Reconquista feature has, for now, been disabled, because it was extremely overpowered and needs a bit of a redesign (e.g., one could take the decision to prepare for a Reconquest war while not even having a single valid enemy to target -- and then be locked out of even normal holy war!). We adapted the code to EMF, but it simply wasn't appropriate and needs a serious beating with the nerf bat before its content will be featured.
		AI landless-type religion heads (i.e., not like a Caliphate but like the Papal State or the Ecumenical Patriarchate) and holy orders will now free themselves from lieges that do not have the same religion.
			This is checked regularly upon a maintenance pulse as well as at the conclusion of every war.
			They will not free themselves from wrong-religion player lieges.
			They will first try to simply vassalize themselves to the liege of their liege if his/her religion matches.
			Their former liege(s) will have a Rightful Subjugation opinion toward them, which allows access to EMF's *Revassalize* CB. Fair's fair.
		Vanilla improvements:
			Improved code for transferring special crown & scepter artifacts which are tied to particular titles upon [usually forced] abdication of their current owner. The artifacts are now properly transferred to the actual heir of the title to which it's linked rather than a different heir.
			All of the succession voting patterns for elective-style succession laws have had a ton of bugfixes from their original form, resulting in significantly better voting patterns.
				We also do not evaluate the electors, elector vote strength, candidate score, or even the candidate pool for titles with elective-style succession laws that are unheld. We know this sounds obvious, but it's not the case in vanilla, and aside from not wasting your CPU now, it also means you'll never receive an alert to nominate a successor to a title that doesn't even exist at the time.
			The land donation mechanics for holy orders such as the Knights of St. John (whom want an island-- but the vanilla code would never be able to succeed in doing that) and the Teutonic Order have been fixed up and made more likely to get the right land to these Orders at the right time.
			Tons of male-only events have been opened to females (though sometimes only when their religion or laws permit).
			Passive bloodline bonuses have been significantly nerfed across the board. By "passive," we mean opinion, command modifiers (e.g., damage to religious enemies), combat rating, etc. Bonuses considered "active" impart some special ability or tendency (i.e., a mechanical bonus), and those have all been preserved.
		*Elective Monarchy Succession*:
			Kingdoms with Elective Monarchy / Feudal Elective succession now allow Counts and not just Dukes to be electors.
			Electors no longer need to be direct vassals of the ruler of the title; they may be a vassal of a vassal and so on.
			Law description updated to no longer indicate that siblings of the ruler are valid candidates for nomination, as it turns out that the candidate pool for its base, hard-coded succession type does not include unlanded siblings -- only the ruler's progeny if unlanded.
		The *Despot* title within the Byzantine or Roman Empire is again an honorary title in EMF instead of a council position when the Conclave DLC is enabled. As such, the restrictions regarding whom you may grant it are again relaxed significantly.
		[SWMH] EMF's automatic de jure expansion of Christian Iberia events (as a result of the Reconquista) are now checked at the conclusion of every war.
		[ ... *Several other changes which we didn't have time to document!* ... ]
	*FIXES:*
		Countless fixes to bugs and user experience issues -- some quite major -- in CK2 v3.X and the *Holy Fury* DLC
		[SWMH] The Varangian Guard now exists and is vassalized to the ERE at all starts after its historical founding. Indeed, we now do a bunch of fancy dynamic stuff with the mercenary title and its initial holder that we've never previously featured.
		Vassal Khans (king-tier nomads) may now pillage settlements, instead of just their independent liege Khagan.
		Death due to health complications from dwarfism now properly displays its death reason instead of "from dwarf_death."
		*4-Interest Factions*:
			The high-priority decisions (i.e., they alert you when available) for calling a faction meeting as a player faction leader are again available.
			Deposed faction leaders will now always defer the faction leadership to a higher-tier ruler in the faction, if applicable.
		Fixed some issues with new code which prevents forced abdication to an heir that has already force-abdicated within the realm.
		Fixed an issue with Merchant Republics and the baron-tier border gore reduction code.
		Siege and Looting Events:
			Several EMF event chains regarding looting, siege defense, siege offense, etc. are now restored, as they had broken due to [undocumented] behavioral changes in the scripting API with different patches.
			Upon a successful siege as the attacker, you will now actually be able to [sometimes] capture the rulers of the holdings you're sieging! For quite awhile now, it was an extreme rarity to ever capture a ruler of a rank higher than Baron.
		Nomads should no longer cause event spam regarding the 'Founding of an Empire' or the 'End of an Empire' when they settle and do whatever other crazy shit it is that they do.
		Fixed an issue where camel cavalry and war elephant combat modifiers from terrain (e.g. river crossing, amphibious landing, nomad province) were missing. Camel cavalry get the same bonuses and penalties as light cavalry, while war elephants get the same bonuses and penalties as heavy cavalry.
		Fixed a bug where Mameluke Raid tactics were set as alternatives to Charge tactics when they were clearly supposed to work as alternatives to Raid tactics. Bonuses and triggers are unchanged because they were Raid bonuses and triggers from the start, but tactic groups and enemy tactic groups are changed.
		Fixed an issue where Cumbric characters had access to two cultural combat tactics; they now only have access to Longbow Volley tactics.
		Fixed issues where Mari, Karelian, Vepsian, Khanty, Estonian, Occitan, Livonian, Szekely, Suebi, Crusader (the culture, not the trait), Turkmen, Oghuz, Khalaj, Bolghar, Avar, Karluk, Kasogi, Kirghiz, Uyghur, Bashkir, Khitan, East Gothic, Udi, Caucasian Avar, Pictish, Prussian, Tibetan, and Chinese characters did not have access to any culture-specific combat tactics.
		Fixed issues where Langobardisch, Canarian, and Jurchen characters had access to cultural combat tactics that did not line up with their cultural castle buildings and/or cultural retinues.
		Fixed an issue where castle and tribal holdings would permanently lose culture-specific and/or terrain-specific buildings if the underlying province's culture changes. Instead, these buildings get deactivated and will only get reactivated if the province switches to a supported culture, just like how it works in the unmodded game.
		Fixed Han, Jurchen, and Tibetan cultural castle buildings so that they work the same way other cultural buildings do (e.g. 6 tiers instead of 4, levies for non-boosted troop types are reduced, troop boost based on maintenance).
		Fixed an issue where Jurchen characters could build two different cultural castle buildings.
		Fixed issues where Canarian and Crusader (the culture, not the trait) characters had access to combat tactics that did not line up with their cultural castle buildings and/or cultural retinues.
		Fixed an issue where Altaic/Magyar/Romanian cultural castle buildings decreased heavy cavalry levies when that is not something that any other cultural castle building does.
		Fixed an issue where cultural castle buildings did not lower horse archer and camel cavalry levies if those levies were not part of the building's boost. This is relevant for castles that would be eligible to get those units through the Steppe Stables and Desert Stables building lines respectively.
		Fixed an issue where Roman characters had access to two cultural retinues; they now only have access to Praetorianus retinues.
		Fixed issues where Icelandic, Mari, Karelian, Vepsian, Khanty, Livonian, Canarian, Arpitan, Crusader (the culture, not the trait), Udi, and Caucasian Avar characters did not have access to any culture-specific retinues.
		Fixed issues where Venetian, Ligurian, and Pictish characters had access to cultural retinues that did not line up with their cultural castle buildings and/or cultural combat tactics.
		Fixed issues where Steppe Barracks, Steppe Stables, and Desert Stables (for both castle and tribal holdings) were checking incorrect conditions, e.g. checking the province owner's culture instead of the underlying province's, checking for cultures that are not the same as the cultures that would have access to appropriate unit types (camel cavalry for Desert Stables, horse archers for the steppe buildings), checking for Plains terrain in tribal steppe buildings despite them upgrading to castle buildings that only work on Steppe terrain, and checking for technology levels that were different from their non-terrain-specific counterparts.
		Fixed an issue where the Desert Stables building line in tribal holdings gave horse archer levies instead of camel cavalry.
		Fixed an issue where higher-level nomad harbor buildings could upgrade into the high-level tribal shipyards that have been disabled by EMF.
		Fixed issues where tooltips in the technology screen would display the unlocking of the following buildings under the incorrect tech and/or incorrect tech level: castle cultural buildings II-VI, Castle Town IV-V, Castle Barracks VI, City Training Grounds II-VI, and City University III. References to Tribal Shipyard III and Tribal Shipyard IV in technology screen tooltips has been removed because those buildings do not exist in EMF.
		Fixed the smith event chain not properly giving tier one armor.
		Fixed the formation of the HRE and French HRE not properly removing Lotharingia from the de jure map.
		[ ... *Literally hundreds of fixed vanilla bugs from patch 3.X and Holy Fury!* ... ]


EMF 8.06 [2018-06-21]
	*CHANGES:*
		When a ruler is deposed by their vassals, they will no longer abdicate to a previously-deposed ruler of the same realm.
		Vassal kings no longer ignore the *Complete King's Peace* crown law. When this law applies to them (i.e., they are a de jure vassal of the crown title(s) in which the law is passed, in short), all of their out-of-realm CB usage has been manually blocked to workaround Paradox's "interesting" choice for king-tier vassals to ignore the law by default.
		Reformed pagans may no longer use the *Religious Reconquest* CB upon rulers of the unreformed / older version of their religion. They will still be able to use the *Holy War* CB in general and, of course, the *Religious Reconquest* CB against other types of pagans when valid.
		Tributaries:
			Nomads are now restricted to using the *Establish Tribute* CB, which establishes a Nomadic-type tributary. Previously, they had access to the *Extort Tribute* CB as well, which establishes a Default-type tributary, and the reverse is true for non-nomads no longer being able to use the Nomadic-type tributary CB.
			The *Free Tributary* CB (a tribute's bid for complete independence) is now available to any ruler that is a tribute, regardless of DLC ownership.
		Threat gain has been nerfed significantly from the previous version, which was a bit of an experiment, and Threat may continue to be a bit of an experiment to get right.
		Baron-tier border gore reduction was added in the previous version, but we forgot to add it to the changelog. Yet, we've now changed it again, so let's review:
			It only acts upon AI rulers.
			Its *previous* behavior was, in extreme summary, to force AI rulers to keep both vassal barons and owned baronies de jure to their containing county by surrendering out-of-place baronies or transferring vassal barons to their de jure lieges.
			Its *new* behavior is essentially to the same end, except that it allows all non-de jure barons and baronies to be so long as they're located within the same independent realm. Thus, we've essentially just deactivated it for top realm-internal border gore reduction.
			Out-of-place baronies are also no longer directly granted to their de jure liege: first, an appropriate type of character is randomly generated to hold the barony, and then they are vassalized to the barony's de jure liege.
	*MINOR:*
		Fleshed-out the Norse-Gael melting pot a bit in terms of smoothness of transition and robustness.
		Seljuk invasion troops now reinforce much more slowly.
		Lucky Rulers now enjoy +6 combat skill.
	*FIXES:*
		You now only recieve notifications for buildings destroyed in your own demesne, not every siege in your entire realm.
		The Immortals, when reborn, now properly share the faith of which Zoroastrian-related faith restored their priesthood.
		Tributary renewal now only applies to the default and nomadic tributary types.
		A bug which was preventing tributary CBs from being available to non-nomads has been fixed.
		The 'special circumstances' variant of the *Holy War* CB no longer checks for a holy war cooldown, so cooldowns incurred from elsewhere could still block the CB (*adding* the cooldown when using this CB was removed in a recent version).
		It is no longer be possible for Norse-Gael melting pot events to fire for provinces or rulers that are already Norse-Gael.


EMF 8.05 [2018-05-23]
	*CHANGES:*
		Compatibility patch with Crusader Kings II v2.8.2.1
		New Game Rule: *Non-Dynastic Succession*
			*Off (Default):* If the player has a non-dynastic heir and dies, then Game Over.
			*On:* If the player has a non-dynastic heir upon death or abdication, then they will continue the game as their heir (with their heir's dynasty), avoiding a Game Over.
				Doesn't apply to republics or nomads! Their dynastic succession is partially hard-coded.
				But it does apply to mercenaries and holy orders, in addition to the usual types of playable rulers.
				This makes the game rule *Matrilineal Marriages* much more reasonable (and historical) to disable.
				Correctly understands the difference between the heir to your primary title and your "real" heir (i.e., the one with a crown icon on your character sheet), so e.g., being elected out of office in an empire with *Feudal Elective Succession* does NOT mean you continue playing as the next emperor but instead that you will play as your "real" heir.
				Also handles all abdications in addition to regular succession. If your abdication heir (i.e., to whomever you are abdicating) is not of your dynasty, it will be handled in the same way as a non-dynastic succession.
		All crown laws traditionally governed by a lifetime cooldown -- *Crown Authority*, *Religion Head Investiture*, and *Imperial Kingdom Creation* -- now expire their cooldowns after 50 years. This is particularly handy for immortal rulers.
		AI rulers are now restricted to hiring their cultural retinue, because it is more often than not the best choice for them strategically. [Plus a little extra immersion.]
		Performance: Heavily optimized the top CPU-eating decision triggers (top 30% of total decision trigger evaluation time).
		Buildings can now suffer damage during or upon completion of a siege, reducing them to a lower tier.
		Casus Belli:
			The *Liberate Religion* CB (sometimes granted by taking the *Strengthen Religion* ambition) introduced with CKII v2.8 (JD) has been disabled, although if you're in such a war in your savegame, it will still complete as it would've prior to its removal. The CB was overpowered, and it overlapped in concept with EMF's preexisting *Religious Reconquest* CB, which requires no ambition to wage (but is not kingdom-tier and uses EMF's *Religious Subjugation* mechanic).
			All 3 types of ducal-tier holy war CBs now increase your progress toward the *Strengthen Religion* ambition upon holy war success. Previously, *Religious Reconquest* and the "special circumstances" version of *Holy War* didn't do so.
			*Ducal County Conquest* (a Jade Dragon CB) can no longer be used on counties that do not directly border the attacker's subrealm.
			Non-nomadic / sedentary AI rulers can no longer use any of the multitude of county conquest CBs, including the two county-tier de jure claim CBs, to target nomadic provinces. Unfortunately the hard-coded war targeting AI for non-nomads still overvalues provinces that would be essentially useless to them, hence the extra level of restriction on them.
			The piety costs of using the *Unjust Conquest* CB have all been increased by +50% in all cases. Gold costs remain the same.
			Pagans can no longer use the *Unjust Conquest* CB -- they already have both religious and non-religious versions of county conquest CBs which cost roughly the same (pagans were a special case for *Unjust Conquest* that was almost free to use).
			All of the tributary CBs (for the 3 normal tribute types, sans the Offmap tribute type) have been standardized to:
				Require a direct border (no seazones), *but* that border may now be through a preexisting tribute, allowing tributes to be chained in all cases.
				AI won't try to prematurely make a tribute out of the Magyars, because if that happens, it's highly unlikely that they'll ever lose enough provinces on the Steppes to trigger the beginning of their migration into the Carpathian Basin.
				Make all tribute types available even if you own only one of either the Horse Lords DLC or the Jade Dragon DLC.
		Border Gore Reduction:
			Several new, more sophisticated measures have been taken against "artificial" border gore for the AI (i.e., not "realistic" border gore due to the nature of feudalism but messes simply consequent of the game's design).
			Additionally, capital-connectedness tracking for independent realms, a measure which is used primarily to quickly identify enclaves and similar, has been souped up to be more accurate more of the time; this will improve the behavior of dozens of mechanics and/or AI reasoning that rely upon capital-connectedness tracking.
		From 867 starts (or 769), Rollo is now more likely to succeed in conquering and controlling the Duchy of Normandy even after submission to the French king -- likely enough that it should be practical for Norman culture and dynasties to take root in their historical region in the majority of games.
	*MINOR CHANGES:*
		Nomads that are granted Lucky Ruler status will now only enjoy half the bonuses to manpower, tax, and population.
		Clergy now directly dislikes (i.e., slight opinion malus) it when rulers have taken out loans. The more they have loaned, the more they dislike it.
		Slightly increased the temporary bonus for AI rulers that manage to dethrone a Karling from one of the traditional Karling kingdoms in 867 (not relevant if *Historical Outcome Promotion* is set to *Passive*, wherein this mechanic is inactive).
		When liberating a same-religion province in a holy war, the bonuses are now significantly higher for the province -- hopefully enough to counteract all the negative modifiers from the war(s) that preceded their liberation.
		Bogomilism is now hostile to Catholicism so long as it is also a heresy of Orthodoxy.
		Added a Sicilian Arabic melting pot, applying to any members of the Arabic culture group ruling in Sicily from 900-1000.
	*FIXES:*
		It is now possible to take the combat trait advancement (CTA) ambitions -- *Develop Personal Combat Skills*, *Become a Trained Fighter*, *Become a Skilled Fighter*, *Become a Formidable Fighter* -- even if you are an independent ruler. It was not intended to exclude independent rulers.
		When the HRE is restored from the TOG bookmark (867), the HRE stem duchies of Upper Lorraine and Lower Lorraine will now properly be restored along with it, instead of remaining part of de jure Lotharingia.
		*Pagan County Conquest* CB now respects the standard conquest restrictions on the Sahara region.
		Fixed an issue with the new "will not lose baronies to gavelkind in your capital county" rule as it related to nomads and merchant republics; they were not properly excluded from the mechanic.


EMF 8.04 [2018-02-17]
	*FIXES:*
		Fixed a bug preventing passage of the laws *Late Feudal Administration*, *Agnatic Succession*, *Agnatic-Cognatic Succession*, and *Absolute Cognatic Succession*. The tooltip would say that you couldn't afford the prestige cost of those law changes when you actually had sufficient prestige. This time we *actually* fixed the bug, we promise.


EMF 8.03 [2018-02-16]
	*MAJOR FIXES:*
		Fixed a bug preventing passage of the laws *Late Feudal Administration*, *Agnatic Succession*, *Agnatic-Cognatic Succession*, and *Absolute Cognatic Succession*. The tooltip would say that you couldn't afford the prestige cost of those law changes when you actually had sufficient prestige.
		Duel engine will now work as well as it ever did.
	*FIXES:*
		Due to a similar type of error as that which caused the law-prestige bug, fixed numerous cases where the "do not disturb" flag was not being cleared as soon as it could be on characters. The flag means that the character is busy with something and affects what will trigger for the character and what decisions will be available to it. The flag would still be cleared after 3 years in the previous version, so some things should simply work a bit better regarding timing of character availability.
		The EMF developer mode decision *DEV: Reveal Title & Province IDs* is no longer displayed all the time, regardless of whether developer mode is enabled.
		Fixed a bug in the logic for the *Third-Party Claim* CB that prevented players from being the target of empire-tier attackers in the general case.
		Fixed the *Restore Court Order* decision for the Anarchy at Samarra setup. The *Court Anarchy* trait is no longer cleared at death; you must enact the decision to restore order.


EMF 8.02 [2018-02-11]
	*MAJOR:*
		Seljuks:
			Now have their own custom invasion AI to ensure that they're likely to make a ruckus
			Use approximately one third of the total event troops that they used with the prior design
			Gain "invader" status and spawn or use the best existing historical character if appropriate in all 3 of these scenarios:
				Games started from the 769 or 867 bookmarks wherein Seljuk and his very young sons must be spawned out of thin air
				[SWMH] Games started from 1018-1035 wherein Seljuk's descendants already exist but are not yet landed
				Games started from 1035+ (part of this is only possible with SWMH), when historically Tughril-Beg Seljuk was first given control over Dihistan by Mahmud Ghaznavid
			Are much more likely to form or usurp the Persian Empire and the kingdoms required for it
			Their custom invasion AI reverts to normal once they've conquered any land in Armenia or Anatolia.
	*CHANGES:*
		Religious Rebels:
			Rebel troop composition has been changed to that of vanilla, which is significantly less likely to be successful in pitched combat.
			Fewer rebel peasants are pressed into the revolt after a successful rebel siege in provinces of the rebels' religion, and their troop composition has also been weakened.
			Rebels can no longer marry, inherit, or receive general events mid-revolt.
			Foreign powers can no longer assist the rebellion (i.e., rebels can no longer have "allies").
			The cap on the number of provinces which can revolt at once (a function of the total number of provinces in the top realm) is now lower (i.e., fewer rebels).
			The revolt risk modifiers associated with conquering a province with a hostile religion in a holy war have been dramatically reduced.
				NOTE: While this does reduce the chance of a revolt or another province joining an ongoing revolt, the primary risk of a religious revolt is actually not governed directly by the game's notion of "revolt risk" and is instead concentrated in the first decade after the holy war (much shorter than the modifier duration of 30 years) with primary factors being the "integration policy" offered with the war's peace terms and the number of holdings actually usurped in the province.
			If the rebels win, the revolt defender now gets the *Revassalize* CB against them, in addition to all the other CBs such as *Holy War* and/or *Religious Reconquest* that they presumably already have.
			Plans exist to further reduce the likelihood that religious rebels will be too powerful to handle in the future, but if these changes suffice, then that'd be best, as we do still want them to provoke a challenge.
		Gavelkind:
			Duke- or higher-tier rulers with any form of split succession law (i.e., *Gavelkind Succession* or *Elective Gavelkind Succession*) will no longer lose barony titles in their capital county to junior heirs.
				NOTE: The "Titles Lost on Succession" alert will still display such baronies, but for those titles (i.e., in your capital county), it can be ignored. Likewise, on the *Succession* window shown when your ruler dies, those baronies will show as "Lost Titles," but on the next game day, all will be normal, and the baronies will revert to your [new] ruler.
			The bonus to demesne limit from having the law *Gavelkind Succession* or *Elective Gavelkind Succesion* is now +50% instead of +30%; the bonus is applied to your base limit, before any laws or other modifiers which affect it.
		Casus Belli:
			All major revolts (civil wars) now only award 30% warscore for capturing the revolt leader instead of instantly defeating the entire rebellion.
			The holy war cooldown imposed by *Pagan County Conquest* has been reduced to 3 years from 5. 
			The de jure ducal-tier holy war CBs (the "standard" ones) have never been able to be used to conquer a duchy with purely nomadic provinces in it (no holdings other than nomad capitals), but due to the way the *Leave A Tribe Behind* (LATB) mechanic works (for preserving province culture and religion, a workaround for vanilla CK2's policy of instant local culture and religion erasure in empty provinces), it is common for otherwise nomadic duchies to have an auto-generated tribe or two in them. This caused the CB code to allow their conquest, as it considered them "settled."
				We've addressed this by skipping both nomad capitals and tribes *which were built by the LATB mechanic* when assessing whether the target duchy is "empty" -- but only if the defender is actually nomadic. Consequently, we'll now see less non-nomadic AI expansion into empty grazing land.
			The AI will no longer try to "liberate" nomadic counties (using the *Liberate County* CB). The definition of a "nomadic province" has been adjusted in the same way as for the ducal-tier holy war CBs.
				Note that the player remains unrestricted in this regard. If you want to conquer and develop the wilds, you're free to do so.
			Newly-ascended AI rulers that are still *Uncrowned* will never declare normal wars unless they are also *Ambitious* and NOT *Patient*. They'll wait for their coronation instead.
		Claims:
			When either of the 2 possible HRE variants are formed or the Byzantine Empire is restored via decision, several held kingdom titles of the former/restorer, usually de jure vassal kingdoms of the empire, are automatically destroyed. Now in these cases, any strong claimant to the to-be-destroyed kingdom titles will get a weak claim on the new empire title if they didn't already have some kind of claim on it.
			Ever notice how titles with *Feudal Elective Succession* have essentially no claimants at any given time? This seemed unrealistic to us, so now, when a ruler holding a Feudal Elective title dies:
				All pretenders to the title (i.e., lower in the line of succession) receive a weak, uninheritable/unpressed claim if they would've not already received a claim.
				If the heir to the title is not of the progeny of the dying ruler, the eldest eligible heir of that ruler's progeny is marked as a "justified claimant" to the title, making the Claimant Faction more likely to support him, ceteris paribus. [He/she will already receive a claim.]
		Game Rules:
			*Titular Title Creation:*
				This new game rule determines which tiers of titular titles (i.e., titles that have no de jure land) available on the map are allowed to be created/formed, subject to their own title creation requirements. You may select:
					*All (Default):* Titular duchies, kingdoms, and empires may all be formed.
					*Kingdoms and Empires:* Only titular kingdoms and empires may be formed; titular duchies may not.
					*Only Empires:* What it says on the tin. Only titular empires may be formed; titular duchies and kingdoms may not.
					*None:* No titular titles of any tier may be formed.
				Note that custom kingdoms and custom empires, while titular in EMF, may still be formed by the player according to *Charlemagne: Custom Realms* game rule's setting.
			*Ahistorical De Jure Empires:*
				The Arabian Empire is now considered a historical de jure empire (joining the ranks of the HRE, ERE, and Persia). There was more than enough continually asserted authority over its domains before its collapse, in terms of game mechanics, to justify this status.
					Given its elevated status, like the other historical de jure empires, it has a higher minimum realm size requirement below *High Crown Authority* than standard empires (200). With *High Crown Authority* and above, it only requires 100 realm size (again, like the others). If it does not meet this requirement, it will be subject to Automatic Empire Disintegration.
			*De Jure Assimilation Duration:*
				Previously, on all of the rule's settings, we used different durations for duchy and kingdom de jure assimilation. Kingdoms took twice as long to assimilate a duchy than an empire did with a kingdom. This appears to have caused bugs with de jure drift when using a non-default setting, so the non-default settings now all have symmetric durations for assimilation of duchies and kingdoms into kingdoms and empires, respectively. The new settings are:
					*Long:* Titles take 200 years to be assimilated de jure.
					*Default:* Duchies take 100 years to be assimilated de jure, but kingdoms only take 50 years. [Unchanged]
					*Short:* Titles take 40 years to be assimilated de jure.
					*Very Short:* Titles take 20 years to be assimilated de jure.
		Secret Religious Cults:
			The *Prepare Grounds* decision for secret religious cults is now limited to one's own demesne, rather than any county in the entirety of their top realm.
			AI characters must now have some society currency to use the *Openly Adopt Faith* decision.
			The AI can now only induct vassals or members of the same court into its secret religion.
		Religious Authority & Antipopes:
			The prestige cost required to appoint an Antipope has been tripled (1500).
			The Religious Authority malus per active Antipope has been halved to -10% (one third of vanilla's value).
		Imperial Decay:
			Increased AI handicap for decay rating change upon imperial succession (i.e., whenever the title changes hands) if the title's decay rating is already greater than 60% (with further handicap past 70%, 80%, and 90%).
			Added a slight AI handicap for using the *Lower Imperial Decay* decision.
		Military:
			When using the *Assemble Mercenary Company* decision to create a mercenary band operating out of your capital, it now depletes your capital county's levy and levy reinforce rate half as much as it did previously. It *already* was significantly less punishing than vanilla, so this should make playing with your own mercenary company (by proxy) a strategically attractive and fun option.
			Added cultural retinues for the Han, Tibetan group, and Jurchen cultures.
			Military technology points gained from battles have been doubled (now same as vanilla).
			Now that modders can separately control the levy maintenance factor for looting armies (distinction added in CKII v2.8), we've raised the standard [non-looting] levy maintenance factor by 30%. The temporary 'War Costs' modifier applied when a primary participant in a war with any of your armies located outside of your (sub)realm has accordingly been made less punishing to demesne tax income (and levy reinforcement rate, to boot).
			Retinue maintenance cost for the AI has been decreased at all difficulty levels (though moreso with increasing difficulty past Normal). The AI is very poor at budgeting for retinues and will tend to spend its entire income or more upon their upkeep. This is a compromise to avoid disabling retinues.
		The *Bulgarian Empire* title is no longer scripted to be held in title history, but the title can still be created.
		The legal duchy limit (i.e., for king- and higher-tier rulers) has been raised to 3 (from 2).
		The legal elector title limit (i.e., for rulers with *Feudal Elective Succession*) has been raised to 2 (from 1).
		The culture conversion rate of provinces directly owned by the Pope (or any religious head with *Papal Succession* -- e.g., Manicheanism) has been reduced in order to avoid strange RNG outcomes like Rome becoming Irish. This is simply due to how variable the cultures of each Pope are, how frequent their succession is, and due to recent changes to make the College of Cardinals care about culture / culture group much less than vanilla when electing the new Pope.
		The *Restore Pope in Rome* decision can now only be used by a top liege when the direct owner of Rome is AI or the decision-taker.
		Sainthood:
			Characters with the traits *Sayyid* or *Mirza* are now eligible to be Saints if they're Christian and meet all the other criteria. These traits are bloodlines, which do not change, whereas religion can certainly change.
			Made it impossible for Saints to have certain nicknames which conflict with Sainthood.
				NOTE: There are still plenty of nicknames allowed which might seem anathema to sainthood (e.g., 'the Butcher'), but we don't consider that to be the case for most of them. We just wanted to address some obvious ones such as the 'the Son of the Devil' and 'the Evil.'
		A variety of CB and other complex tooltips (such as those for title creation requirements) have been simplified using CKII v2.8's new ability to only conditionally show [hopefully relevant] parts of tooltips. We'll continue to simplify more old tooltips in this way as we move forward.
	*MAJOR FIXES:*
		The dynamic 3-way Mongol Empire split into the Golden Horde, il-Khanate, and Chagataid / Moghul Khanate is now correctly working again. It had been disabled since CKII 2.8 arrived due to subtle, undocumented changes in the scripting API's behavior which required a lot of time to find.
	*FIXES:*
		The Council of Saint-Felix event for Catharism should no longer ever have a title of "The Council Of" (council of where?).
		[SWMH] Fixed an issue of doubled buildings for the new Chinese and Tibetan cultures.
		Fixed a bug related to the way the holy war CBs calculated whether their target duchy was only full of nomadic provinces.
		When count- and higher-tier rulers "mass convert" due to a lost holy war, the converted-to religion's authority will properly be increased by 1% per such ruler rather than *decreased* by 1%.
		[SWMH] When either of the two HRE variants are formed from 867, the de jure reassignment which follows will now be WAD; it broke with EMF 8.0 (Hydra1). Notably, the new duchies of Bouillon and Jülich were not correctly handled.
		[Vanilla] Seljuk will now correctly spawn and conquer from either the 769 or 867 starts. We had SWMH-specific references in our code that was supposed to be for EMF+Vanilla, and it broke things for Seljuk.
		The portrait tooltip of the Chinese Emperor will no longer show an errant "Imperial Decay: %" status line.
		[Vanilla] Fixed several titular titles being formable when they should not.


EMF 8.01 [2017-12-14]
	*FIXES:*
		[SWMH] Can now build trade posts as advertised by the trade zones map mode.


EMF 8.0 [2017-12-10]
	*MAJOR:*
		Compatibility patch with Crusader Kings II v2.8.1 (Jade Dragon)
		All duke-tier *Holy War* CBs (3) now use a new mechanic unlike any other: Religious Subjugation
			Goals include challenge improvement, reduction of the "gamey" factor of holy war with a much more realistic model of it, preservation of historically relevant dynasties, much more dynamic and complex outcomes, and promotion of culturally diverse realms with more religious aftermath and without losing the "spoils of war" fun factor (i.e., still going to gain land for yourself).
			When a holy war is won, the holy warrior will choose among three strategic integration choices on a spectrum from open arms to mailed fist that shall set the tone of their peace terms to the conquered.
				This choice will significantly impact not only how the conquest itself will complete but also the integration of the affected peasant population and spread of the conqueror's faith locally for many years to come.
				An in-game tooltip will remind you of the pros & cons of each side of the spectrum of three choices.
			The war loser will then be presented with an ultimatum: bend the knee and convert to conqueror's religion, or forfeit all of their titles within the target duchy.
			If the war loser refuses to submit, then the same ultimatum will be given to each of their direct vassals whom have subrealm titles that are de jure vassals of the duchy.
				If any of them also refuse, the ultimatums will continue descending the realm tree.
			If a ruler receives such an ultimatum and chooses to bend the knee:
				They'll be able to choose to either truly convert religion or only publicly (i.e., take their old faith as a secret religion).
				If they are of the same tier/rank as the war winner, their same-tier titles will be destroyed.
				They'll ask all of their vassals to convert with them (a request which will also descend recursively down the realm tree from liege to direct vassal).
					Such vassals will have 3 options: truly convert, only publicly convert (i.e., take old faith as secret religion), or flat out refuse to convert at all.
						If they refuse outright, they will not ask their direct vassals to convert with them, of course, so the conversion down the realm tree will stop with them.
			Whenever a ruler mass-converts in these ways, so will all close kin, spouses, and dynasty members in their court convert with them.
			Forcing a pagan king to bend the knee and convert might trigger the sainthood mechanic (for either the convertor or converted, depending).
			Once all decisions on the war loser realm's side have been made, the winner will receive an event showing exactly what will happen (who bent the knee; which titles will be usurped; and statistics like total number of nobles converted, titles seized, and same-religion lords liberated, etc.)
				If no counties would've been seized at all, then the option to usurp a single county (despite promises made otherwise in those ultimatums, which does have ramifications) will be provided for up to 3 different counties selected according to both the base criterion allowing it to be usurped at all and their fitness (i.e., the top 0-3 counties in terms of holding count). Base criterion for being allowed to usurp a county (in the target duchy) in this case:
					The owner of the county has at least another county.
					The owner of the county is AI-controlled (need to think more about this in multiplayer, hence this restriction).
					There were at least 2 total possible counties that could've been gained in the war (if every ruler had refused the ultimatum and all titles were taken).
			Note that no king-tier holy war CBs have been adapted to use this mechanic yet, but it seems likely in the future that this very dynamic sort of approach will again be applied.
			For submodders:
				The *Holy War* (both regular and 'special circumstances' variant) and *Religious Reconquest* CBs' usage of this new Religious Subjugation mechanic may be toggled with the older, traditional holy war success effect via a flag which can be set in `emf_config`. This saves having to override all of `00_cb_types.txt` if the old way is desired.
				As always, see `events/emf_config.txt` for the documentation / example usage and override/modify `events/emf_config_user.txt` to actually change the configuration.
		Better Religious Rebels:
			The religious [peasant] revolt mechanic has been completely rewritten from vanilla. Religious rebels can now:
				Spawn from multiple nearby revolt source provinces as well as welcome other rebels of their religion from other provinces into the fold as the rebellion rages.
				Call-to-arms nearby independent coreligionists to seek assistance in their rebellion.
				Loot every settlement they sack.
				Press coreligionist peasants from provinces of their religion into their army upon occupying a settlement. Can you say, "wildfire?"
				Actually be a challenge to defeat.
				If they win the rebellion:
					They'll usually form an aesthetically pleasing and yet organically formed realm, rather than a smattering of random counties or a perfect little de jure chunk of land.
					Form a titular duchy until/if they can form a de jure title. These duchies are named, e.g., "Catholic Segovia."
					They'll receive the new *Peasant Ruler* trait and some survivability bonuses for the first generation.
			Such revolts are now much more causally linked to holy wars and their chosen integration policy: if you holy war a bunch or are very harsh, expect some trouble. This is in contrast to the vanilla system for revolts in which there is very rarely any clear link between why a given province revolted and your actions as a ruler.
		Imperial Decay Facelift:
			Imperial Decay is now a percentage from 0-100%, with distinct effects which follow a curve of downward spiral at every percentage point.
			Its effects have become considerably more sinister.
			A character's exact ID rating can now be seen either via the usual character modifier or via their portrait tooltip.
			The *Lower Imperial Decay* decision can now be used when your decay rating is as low as 3%.
	*CHANGES:*
		A whole ton of unlogged changes and fixes, frankly. We didn't have the time to catch-up the changelog to all of the development this cycle. But, here's some of it:
		Titular title automatic destruction:
			Now also applies to the player, but not when the player has made a titular title his primary title or when the player has specifically created the titular title.
			Does not fully deactivate titles after destroying them but instead simply marks them as defunct and prevents their creation (and that 'Titles You Can Create' alert). This allows the titles to be found via 'Find Title/Region', viewed in the title screen, and their history to still be viewed.
		Titular title creation:
			Titular duchy creation is now disabled for the AI, as it was creating them pathologically to no end.
			Titular kingdoms can once again be created, but the creator must be independent and either have at least 5 counties in their subrealm or be a republic.
		Two new cultural melting pots: *Neapolitan* and *Sicilian*
			Both melting pots are "top-down" (convert lieges before their direct vassals), and a player in the crosshairs of either melting pot has the option to stick with his current culture. If he does so, all of his vassals will also resist the melting pot.
			Both melting pots will start some time after 1100 and should definitely be wrapped up by 1150 and require a *liege* source culture that is Norman/Frankish in origin.
			*Neapolitan* culture will now arise in its corresponding region with other, additional allowed vassal/courtier/province source cultures of:
				[SWMH] Greek, Umbrian, Laziale, Tuscan, Lombard, and Langobardisch (plus liege cultures of Norman/Frankish/Arpitan).
				[Vanilla] Italian and Greek (plus liege cultures of Norman/Frankish).
			*Sicilian* culture will now arise in its corresponding region with other, additional allowed vassal/courtier/province source cultures of:
				[SWMH] Arabic (entire culture group), Greek, Umbrian, Laziale, Tuscan, Lombard, and Langobardisch (plus liege cultures of Norman/Frankish/Arpitan).
				[Vanilla] Arabic (entire culture group), Italian, and Greek (plus liege cultures of Norman/Frankish).
			Note that the Sicilian melting pot only takes place on the Island of Sicily and within Calabria, whereas the Neapolitan melting pot covers the rest of the Kingdom of Sicily.
			Additionally, the English melting pot has been rewritten to use the same basic logic as the Sicilian and Neapolitan melting pots; this approach is simply more robust and flexible.
		Western Christians (e.g., Catholics) that aren't heretics may now target pagans in the Saxony/Pomerania/Bohemia/Moravia region with the 'special circumstances' variant of the *Holy War* CB, which costs no piety.
			To qualify as an attacker, none of your lieges (if any) may differ from your religion.
		The 'special circumstances' variant of the *Holy War* CB has been tweaked (aside from using the new religious subjugation mechanic):
			Reduced truce timer (5 years instead of 10)
			No longer incurs a holy war cooldown
		Plotting to revoke a vassal barony is once again allowed.
			Previously, we retracted the feature (and it was never in vanilla), because we felt that it was too gamey in practice. This was due to myriad issues: one example would be that the player can raise their levies and park them over the baron's capital province prior to the war actually starting (because plot-fired wars are scripted and bypass the no-raised-levies rule), winning the war and getting a free revocation without a fight.
			However, this is also a rather nice little feature to have, so we've taken some measures to address those issues.
				They'll put up a bit more of a fight reliably now.
				There is a 7 year cooldown on plot-revoking a barony. If you need a second barony faster, you'll simply have to revoke it the normal way.
			Note that to qualify to plot-revoke a barony, the following conditions must be met:
				It must be within one of your held counties for which the de jure duchy title is also personally held or that duchy contains your capital.
				You must be duke- or higher-tier.
				You cannot be a merchant republic (they don't get to revoke stuff willy nilly).
		[Vanilla] Added new culture *Neapolitan* with proper cultural buildings, cultural retinues, and cultural command tactics. *Neapolitan* already existed on SWMH.
		Added cultural command tactic preferences for flank leaders of the following cultures:
			Swedish
			Danish
			Icelandic
			[SWMH] Umbrian
			[SWMH] Laziale
			[SWMH] Dalmatian
		Deactivated the *Demand Gavelkind* player-only targeted decision added as part of the *Reaper's Due* DLC, because it makes no freakin' sense beyond "stuff that would be cool if I wanted to be gamey."
		When (and if) the Kingdom of Hungary is created as a result of the Magyar migration into the Carpathian Basin, all claims on the Magyar tribal kingdom title will be transferred to the new Hungary title before the tribal title is destroyed.
		Better handling of logic throughout EMF for determining whether a character will inherit titles, specifically with regard to the case of prevailing *Religion Head Investiture* law and characters nominated to be bishops.
		Traits like *Uncrowned*, *Crowned By The Pope*, and others that pertain to current rulership status are now removed immediately upon all abdications (rather than waiting for a maintenance pulse to fix it).
		The decision *Convert to Attacker Religion* has been fully removed. Note that there are now other mechanics in EMF which do accomplish virtually the same thing but with a lot more style and a lot fewer issues.
		The "Constantine's Return" event which can convert the ERE to Iconoclast if losing in multiple wars will no longer affect the TOG (867) bookmark -- only the Charlemagne (769) start.
		[SWMH] Finns and Balts, while they can still raid, are no longer considered seafarers, so these AIs will no longer range far and wide with their mighty tribal navies to raid.
		[SWMH] Most of the North African / Berber cultures are now considered seafarers, so they *will* occasionally show up on your shores to raid.
		The AI will now only accept skilled Jewish courtiers into their court (via the fairly common event that spawns them) if they already have some sort of Jew at court. This might be made less strict in the future, as efforts have been made in the base game in CKII v2.8.0 to stop the rampant issues with realms turning Jewish in no time flat due to Jewish educators.
		By request of a submodder, we've added 'custom_jerusalem' and 'custom_mesopotamia' geographical regions to EMF. [It is very difficult to keep these files synchronized if overriding them as a submodder.]
		The AI, unless a Patrician / Merchant Republic, now has minimum income requirements to hire new retinues. It's for their own good.
	*FIXES:*
		The "not interested in hearing about this [claimant] adventurer's every movement" options in the events which notify you of the travels of the claimant adventurer which is targeting you were not working as intended; they will now actually stop such notifications from being sent to you. (thanks @Toa Kraka)
		*Imperial Reconquest* CB again properly forces you to use its tiered conquest system rather than all territory under *any* of the conquest regions being a valid target (was kind of like vanilla but still limited to the sum of all the tiered regions, in the previous version).
		The *Norman County Conquest* CB tooltip is now fully consistent in describing that it costs 100 piety to use (rather than claiming 200 in one place and 100 in another).
		Cosmetic fix to the Sainthood announcement event (mismatched event window border dimensions).


EMF 7.03 [2017-08-29]
	*MAJOR:*
		Full compatibility patch with Crusader Kings II v2.7.2 (save-compatible)
		[SWMH] Added new formation mechanics for England (most relevant to campaigns started in 867):
			In 867, Wessex, Mercia, East Anglia, and Northumbria are all now de jure kingdoms, while the Kingdom of England title is titular.
			When titular England is formed:
				England's de jure status will "modernize," becoming the large de jure title with which we're so familiar and rendering those "petty" English kingdoms titular.
				It will become the creator's primary title.
				Any "standard" titular kingdom title held by the creator (e.g., Wessex after England absorbs its de jure territory upon formation) will be automatically destroyed if possible.
					Custom-created kingdom titles will not be destroyed.
					[WIP: Any strong claimants to the destroyed kingdoms will become weak claimants to England.]
			To form England, the requirements are similar to forming a de jure kingdom: the main difference is that instead of requiring half of the de jure counties of the kingdom, you'll need to control at least half of the English **geographical region**.
		Fewer weird AI titular titles and less artificial border gore:
			In order to reduce border gore induced by artificial game mechanics and reduce instances of strange titles being on the wrong parts of the map consistently, the AI now automatically destroys any titular titles that it holds but no longer requires to remain the same rank.
			In practice, this is almost exclusively limited to "tribal" titular titles (though some titular titles notorious for artifically inducing border gore via gavelkind, such as the Kingdom of Asturias, will usually also be destroyed by this mechanic eventually). This is functionally very similar to the way in which "tribe=yes" titles worked before CKII v2.2 (Charlemagne) phased out their usage in vanilla.
			Note to submodders: the logic behind this only executes on a periodic pulse rather than a title transfer on_action, so don't worry about titular titles being auto-destroyed out from under your scripting. Further, you can mark any titular title with the flag 'emf_autodestroy_exemption' and prevent it from even being considered by the subsystem.
		*Decline Empire Election* self-targeted decision:
			Sometimes, you don't want to become Emperor. This self-targeted diplo-decision (i.e., available when right-clicking on your own portrait) allows you to waive any right to the inheritance of a feudal elective empire within the lifetime of your current ruler.
			The waiver cannot be revoked during the lifetime of your ruler, but your successor(s) will inherit normally (unless you use this decision again on them).
			NOTE: Even after waiving the election, it's still possible/likely to appear within the UI to be the heir to such an empire, but this doesn't matter. The second in the line of succession will inherit the empire upon the death of the Emperor regardless of this minor UI incoherency. Your character will have a visible modifier to remind you that you've waived the election.
	*CHANGES:*
		Casus Belli and Wars:
			AI is no longer allowed exception to the *Medium Crown Authority* requirement to use the *De Jure Duchy Claim* CB. Previously, the CB's extra availability to the AI was motivated by the desire for cleaner borders, and while that was effective, it also led to outcomes such as France reclaiming Normandy far earlier than was historically plausible. Realism and consistency is more important than our anachronistic border aesthetics.
			AI is no longer allowed to attempt to make the AI Magyars a tributary until they've either migrated into the Carpathian Basin (due to losing enough provinces to their neighbors) or the year 920. This should improve the likelihood that the Magyars will migrate into the Carpathians, because if they gain tributary status, they're not likely to lose any more provinces on the Steppe.
			[SWMH] Added new, more historically suited and highly sophisticated CB to be used in the various wars in the Viking Invasion of Britain (TOG). Also fixed-up the initial scripted invasion setup from SWMH, as it was in poor shape.
			*HRE Unification Claim* CB:
				Now works like a hybrid claim-and-subjugate CB which actively tries to minimize as much conquest-induced border gore as possible.
				Previously, if the player had a strong or pressable weak claim on the target kingdom, the CB was blocked in favor of using the standard *Claim* CB. This is no longer the case; if both CB types are valid for you, you can choose your poison. ***TIP:*** If you can afford its [massive] prestige cost, the *HRE Unification Claim* CB will work better in general and in your favor (with virtually no downside beside the cost).
			Added *Capture Italian Border* CB for Sicilian-region Normans vs. the Byzantine Empire:
				Seizes all Byzantine border counties (within the Sicilian region) on success. [This is quite a lot!]
				Costs 200 piety (twice the county conquest CB) to use. Related: If either this new CB or the slightly older *Norman County Conquest* CB invalidate for any reason, your piety costs will be now be refunded.
				Careful: if you lose such an offensive war, the reverse demand from the Emperor is going to be especially steep for what is essentially a state of total war (upon a medieval budget). Seek a white peace if things have gone sour, as they oft unpredictably do when trying to fight the Roman Empire.
				EMF will automatically hide the regular *Norman County Conquest* CB so long as at least 2 such counties would be seized using this CB, and otherwise, the *Norman County Conquest* CB is available instead.
		Tribes:
			Nerfed the base levy & tax provided by tribal holdings very significantly. Tribes will be significantly weaker at outset of the game, but those which can earn enough money and prestige to develop their tribal holdings will quickly grow in power as the game progresses, remaining nevertheless still slightly weaker than previously when fully-developed too. This seems to have addressed a lot of tribal balance issues (and increases difficulty in a fun way).
			Tribal vassals will now be slightly less enthusiastic about answering call-to-arms from their liege (but still much more enthusiastic than a regular call-to-arms).
			All tribal unit spawns now suffer standard attrition (previously was only half) and have a double-duration cooldown of 3 years.
		Defensive pagans:
			All such religions have had their levy size bonuses eliminated and their garrison size bonuses standardized (usually reduced).
			The mercenary decision *Summon Devout Warriors* now costs +50% piety.
		Halfdan, Ivar, Ubbe, and Sigurdr (of the alleged Ragnar Lodbrok) will now *never* offer to swear fealty to a Christian king when losing to them in a war, and they will also never use the *Convert to Attacker Religion* decision that more or less amounts to the same.
		(867) A Future with Better Progression toward Ottonian-like HRE Formation:
			This feature is actually still WIP, and it is intended to be later complemented by another module that actually waits and finds "potential Ottos" and improves the chances that they'll rise to power. For now, we've only worked on the other side of the equation: if a non-Karling does somehow gain a traditionally Karling title from a Karling, they and potentially their successor(s) will receive a small bonus to make it more likely that they'll rise even further.
				If *Historical Outcome Promotion* is set to *Sandbox*, none of this will happen.
				This is part of our personal philosophy on dynamism in the game: when the AI manages to do great things on its own, give it positive feedback so that it might be able to do even greater things. Of course, this requires a sense of scope and balance, but the idea is to avoid a mess of vaguely interesting AIs and instead promote several that stand out with their own story (and that of those they vanquished).
			Initial availability of the *HRE Unification Claim* CB has been slowed so that it's more possible for non-Karlings to re-create the HRE. However, it speeds up after 900 AD and continues doing so until 950 when there is no further impedence. This has purely pragmatic motivations.
			Independence factions will be less feisty within the Frankish Realm if the HRE is still considered being restored.
			The AI will not declare war with the *HRE Unification Claim* CB upon targets defending against a civil war (again, purely pragmatic motivations).
		Tweaked the *Turmoil in The East (1219)* bookmark's timing and selectable characters, as one (Yolande) was essentially an automatic game-over.
		The religious head title for *East African Pagan Reformed* now has creation requirements.
		Better Submodding / Personal Modding Support to Come: ***emf_config:***
			The *emf_config* module will provide a central place (*events/emf_config.txt*) where the 3 main types of EMF "configuration" occur:
				Before EMF does its own campaign initialization
				After it does initialization (but before the welcome event)
				Upon every save/reload of a previous savegame (for preserving save-compatibility as the configuration changes)
				While that file will explain a ton of variables and flags that can be set there and sets its own defaults, there is a separate file *events/emf_config_user.txt* which contains 3 empty events invoked right after "vanilla EMF" has done whatever it was going to do in each configuration stage. This is the perfect place for a submod / your personal mod to override and tweak a sweeping amount of behavior with absolutely minimal conflict with actual EMF files, making your diffs upon new releases either easy or trivial.
				These are tweaks & behavioral changes that are inappropriate for game rules, BTW. Some game rules might spawn from the popularity of certain configuration options, but that is merely a bonus.
				At the time of this release, what's configurable via *emf_config* is largely limited to the behavior of the first pass at our "Anti-Dynastic Entrenchment" feature for the Karling dynasty (as well as the behavior of our mechanics that prevent nomadic province culture / religion erasure, e.g. Leave A Tribe Behind). In the future, much more will be made simple to tweak via this interface.
	*FIXES:*
		*MAJOR:* As an Imperial liege, you may now grant kingdoms to feudal vassals in order to convert them to Imperial (!!).
		Imperial Decay:
			"Historical" decay ratings (i.e., set in history files) are again respected, so, e.g., the Byzantine Empire starts with a rating of 30 and the HRE with a rating of 10 in 1066, while the Abbasid Caliphate starts with a rating of 50 in 867.
			*MAJOR:* Mechanic should now work properly across save & reload! A change in the way the base game considers variables in CKII v2.7.1 activated a dormant bug in EMF which resulted in decay ratings resetting to 0 when they shouldn't.
		Fixed all instances of code suffering from a regression in the base game regarding character creation. Specifically, it gave them a random dynasty when it should not, and it randomized certain traits when it should not. Notable affected cases (not nec. all the time): Rollo/Hrolfr, Seljuk, Timur, Sabuktagin, Temujin and much of his family, the Imamah Claimant (a Fatimid), the founder of the Assassins (usually Hassan i-Assan), reincarnations of Isis, etc. Thanks to @Mafiabrett for the identification of the solution to the problem.
		Fixed a crash resulting from Crusade Adventurers when the code is deciding what to do with them after a Crusade. Fixed some other Crusade code oversights.
		[Vanilla] Fixed the Latin Empire being impossible to create.
		Isis will stop getting the *Uncrowned* trait, along with potentially other rulers of primary-type titles.
		Catharism, Bogomilism, and Manichaeanism have always been designed by us to be religions which can support Investiture Law (religious head picks bishops vs. choice of free investiture). However, at some point CK2 started caring that we weren't also defining these religions as having the investiture feature (previously, it was enough to make the law available and have a religious head); now, the Investiture mechanic (including the appropriate Councils of Elders and other such variants upon the College of Cardinals enabled by the *Sons of Abraham* DLC) works like a charm for these religions again.


EMF 7.02 [2017-05-05]
	*CHANGES:*
		The *Pagan Subjugation* casus belli can now only be used upon enemies with whom the attacker shares a realm border. Attackers of Norse religion, however, may use the CB against enemies up to 1 seazone away.
			Hopefully this helps address the "Overpowered Balts/Finns" situation with current game balance, but it should also simply be more sane everywhere.
		The Imperial Decay mechanic no longer builds special buildings in the emperor's demesne to apply its malus to demesne levies. This end is now achieved directly via the character modifier which it already applies to emperors.
		Imperial Decay, previously disabled when playing Ironman for technical reasons (base game save corruption issues), is now experimentally enabled regardless of your Ironman setting.
	*FIXES:*
		[MAJOR] Fixed an issue which would prevent all factions but the 4-interest factions from being formable/joinable under certain circumstances.


EMF 7.01 [2017-04-25]
	*MAJOR:*
		Compatibility patch with Crusader Kings II v2.7.1 (save-compatible)
		Extensive overhaul of vanilla's secret religion society events & decisions to additionally support all religions/heresies in EMF as well as correct numerous vanilla bugs.
		A variety of performance optimizations as well as some stability improvement that's applicable when running long games without saving [and exiting] and reloading the game occasionally (only an issue due to an undocumented engine limitation).
	*EXTENSIONS TO PATCH (2.7.1):*
		Vanilla regularly stimulates the AI to join a select few secret religion societies. EMF extends this periodic AI-society stimulation to all secret religions. This ensures that the correct secret religious societies are active whenever it makes sense for them to be-- in any possible scenario that may develop in any type of campaign.
		Vanilla features [county-tier] title decisions (i.e., diplo-decisions accessible when right-clicking a title's CoA/shield in the game) which give you the option to secretly convert to the religion of a holy site in your demesne, but it only supports a limited range of religions, and it supports no religions which are heresies at the earliest start date. EMF expands these decisions to cover all possible religions, including those that are heresies.
			NOTE: You cannot actually convert directly to a heresy this way, but if the heresy becomes mainstream (through EMF's religious emancipation mechanic, through the older province heresy takeover mechanic introduced in *Sons of Abraham*, through special event chains such as EMF's *Isma'ili Caliphate Rising*, or through history scripting for different start dates).
	*CHANGES:*
		Understanding 4-interest faction moods has never been easier:
			Hover the cursor over the name of a 4-interest faction in the Factions View, and you will be able to see the overall mood of the faction clearly.
				The triggered character modifier icons which indicated membership & mood on a faction member's character screen are now gone, because this system is much more intuitive, less prone to inconsistencies, and far more performance-friendly (triggered modifiers drain performance like nothing else).
			The faction description tooltips have also been cross-referenced with the latest code, updated, more detail added to their likes/dislikes as well as general information upon how to understand faction relations added, and general readability improved.
			The previously inconsistent faction mood names and their associated text colors have been changed to uniformly be:
				Friendly (green)
				Neutral (gray)
				Opposed (yellow)
				Hostile (red)
		The decision *Arrange Courtier Marriages* has been removed. *Toggle Marriage Decisions* has also been removed due to consequent lack of purpose.
		[SWMH] Increased starting retinue of William 'Iron-Arm' de Hauteville and his descendent for 1043-1066 starts by +50%. For the AI, total starting troop count depends upon the *Historical Outcome Promotion* game rule setting, but so long as it isn't set to *Passive*, a player will receive ~2.25K troops.
		(EU4 Converter) Patched to work with the very recently-released EU4 v1.21
	*MINOR:*
		Events which poll the game state continually, looking for vanilla Steam achievement requirement fulfillment, will no longer consume resources in EMF, since playing with CK2 mods prevents unlocking Steam achievements anyway.
		(M&M) It is no longer possible to abduct Isis as a devil worshipper or assassin. It is also no longer possible to sacrifice her to Satan.
	*FIXES:*
		Fixed an issue with the monastic order for Miaphysite and Apostolic branches preventing its usage by heresies that have become mainstream (thanks to @majesty8 for reporting).
		Fixed the player-only version of the *Ask Liege for Title* decision not actually granting the appropriate title if the liege decides to acquiesce.
		Fixed the *Fabricate Treason* plot icon not being shown.
		Fixed a very rare issue with event text localisation of the "ascetic-type noun" for Coptic *Desert Father* and *Desert Mother* characters.
		Decadent dynasty members will no longer attempt to ask for money from those whom have already tried to negotiate with them to drop their decadent ways.
		Added some missing CB localisation for the *Norman County Conquest* CB.
		Fixed many issues with the events for *The Assassins* society in EMF 7.0, as part of an EMF-wide project to review & adjust all content in the game that, historically, should actually regard Isma'ili Islam rather than Shia Islam (everything related to the Hashshashin is such a case).
		Fixed an issue wherein the *Lower Crown Authority Faction* would disband / be unable to form so long as the liege was incapable.


EMF 7.0 [2017-03-22]
	*MAJOR:*
		Compatibility patch with Crusader Kings II v2.7.0.2
		[SWMH] Various support for SWMH's latest map overhaul and timeline extension back to 1043.
	*CHANGES:*
		[SWMH] Levy boosts for underrepresented regions intended to improve balance are no longer based upon religion but are now location-specific. E.g., Muslims in Spain, Sicily, and Anatolia will no longer be overpowered simply because their religion happens to occur in dense areas that are not underrepresented on SWMH.
		[SWMH] William Iron-Arm de Hauteville and his successor in the period 1043-1066 will receive a small starting retinue to help represent their actual military power in the area if *Historical Outcome Promotion* (game rule) is not set to *Passive*. The starting troops will be twice as large if set to *Aggressive*.
		[SWMH] The Cumbric castle cultural building has been switched from the generic North Germanic heavy infantry building to the archers used by the Welsh.
		[SWMH] Cumbric rulers now have access to the Longbowmen retinue, and their cultural command combat tactic is now the Longbow Volley.
		Normans in the Sicilian region now have access to a county conquest CB against non-Normans within the area. This is particularly relevant for 1043-1066 on SWMH.
		The Bektashi [Holy] Order is once again Sunni; in a relatively recent past release, it was changed to Isma'ili, but this was ill-informed. The *original* Bektashi Order were Sunni devout and not Twelvers; when the order was 'revitalized' after the CK2 era by an Isma'ili, things changed, but for our purposes, they're Sunni. This has the upside of also making the number of holy orders between Sunni vs. Isma'ili even again.
	*FIXES:*
		Fixed a case where the event which is supposed to auto-destroy the Isma'ili, Shiite, or Zaydi Caliphate when inherited or usurped by a person that is not a close relative of the former holder would lead to an infinite loop of the two rulers re-usurping the title every game day.
		Druze, though part of the Muslim religious group, should now have access to matrilineal marriages.
		Special CB restrictions on conquest of the Sahara region again apply. The geographical region that defines the 'Sahara Region' was accidentally deleted at some point over the last several releases, so none of the protections were in effect.
		It is no longer possible to plot to revoke vassal clans' clan titles as a nomad.


EMF 6.06 [2016-12-31]
	*MAJOR:*
		Nomads:
			Nomads who settle may now do so only as tribals, they cannot settle directly to feudal or merchant republic.
			Settling is done via the county title (right-click on the county title to access the *Adopt Tribalism* decision) and may be performed on personally-owned counties where either a tribal holding already exists or one can be constructed (there will need to be an empty holding slot, and the province either needs to contain a castle, contain a temple if the nomad is Muslim, or the nomad's capital must contain a 2nd-level Baghatur Council). The process works roughly as before, save for the fact that all clan vassals will be given the option of either also going tribal and remaining your vassal or staying nomadic and becoming independent. They are only likely to go independent if they personally hold at least three provinces and their capital is in the steppes.
			Settling in a province which isn't also your current capital now properly converts nomadic buildings to tribal (in the newly-constructed tribal holding).
			The new tribal realm has some starting Tribal Organization. For pagans, it is Low. For non-pagans or reformed pagans without a castle in their capital province, it is Medium. For non-pagans or reformed pagans with a castle in their capital province, it is High.
			Altaic tribal rulers who are independent, have 1000 Prestige, and are either Duke or King tier now have a decision which allows them to go nomadic.
		New Game Rule: *Historical Outcome Promotion*
			NOTE: This rule's implementation throughout the myriad places in our code in which it may matter is very partial at best right now. Over the next few releases, we'll be fleshing it out to be more comprehensive.
			Rule settings:
				*Default:* EMF will strike a compromise between a historical sandbox and aggressively promoting in-game historical outcomes. This is, more or less, what we've always done, with some exceptions (the default is now slightly less aggressive).
				*Aggressive:* EMF will aggressively try to promote historical outcomes in your campaign where possible and within reason (and where we've actually been able to implement code to do so).
					The extra Norse adventurers which spawn after the start of the Viking Age will be more common.
				*Passive:* EMF will only passively promote historical outcomes. This is essentially a sandbox and shouldn't be expected to lead to particularly historical outcomes.
					No extra Norse adventurers will be spawned after the start of the Viking Age.
					Sunni Caliph will never order the murder of the Manicheans in Baghdad.
					The Seljuks' scripted invasion of Anatolia following their conquest of Armenia which leads to the formation of Rum if successful -- this event will never fire at all with *Passive*.
					Rollo's scripted invasion of Normandy will not happen.
	*CHANGES:*
		If the Paulician Patriarchate is ever inherited or usurped by a non-Paulician, the title will either be transferred back to the former owner (if they are alive and Paulician) or destroyed.
		Non-seafaring duchy adventures now receive ships.
		The *Drunkard* trait now has a -0.5 health malus instead of none.
		Killing a dynasty member at a coronation duel will now earn the *Kinslayer* trait, and the family of the fallen will not forget the brutish incident. Only the duel challenger is subject to these repercussions.
		The *Convert to Attacker Religion* decision is now available for unreformed pagans under wider circumstances, and when a religious war defender chooses to take the decision, they will also be subjugated by the attacker when possible. [Fewer holy wars invalidating with no return just as you're about to offer peace.]
	*FIXES:*
		Fixed issue wherein *Automatic Empire Disintegration* would apply to the invading Mongol Empire if the Horse Lords DLC was disabled.
		A Strong Basileus ascending in the Roman Empire will now properly reduce Imperial Decay by 5.
		Rare case where a non-independent crusade victor that also chose to keep the crusade title could sometimes gain vassals belonging to a different character who was a previous crusade victor has been fixed.
		Fixed an exploit with plots where a player could switch to another plot target immediately upon receiving the plot success event and the effects of the old plot would apply to the new target.
		Rollo's existing children will now also change to his new dynasty when he converts.
		Fixed Pope's targeting of investiture laws to only look at primary titles.
		Annual maintenance event checking for existence of coronation traits on kings and emperors added (solves issue regarding imperial vassal kings, which do not receive coronations, not getting the *Uncrowned* trait if they gain independence and thus become feudal).
		The Rollo in the history files is now removed at game start for the Old Gods scenario, to avoid the possibility of having two Rollos in play at the same time.


EMF 6.05 [2016-11-25]
	*CHANGES:*
		Compatibility patch with Crusader Kings II v2.6.3.
		(Reaper's Due) Upgraded all instances of new character spawns that had a randomized culture to only randomly select from cultures that are actually present on the map. This prevents very weird appearances of period-inappropriate or simply irrelevant cultures in the game.
	*FIXES:*
		Fixed an issue with insufficient auto-abort conditions for the *Plot to Gain Vassal Title* (credit to @Toa Kraka for the report).
		Fixed a bug with the trigger for the "Duchy with none of its de jure Counties under holder" case for the *Plot to Gain Vassal Title*.
		Fixed a couple typos in our new "Spouse is informed of divorce" event which prevented some intended divorce-related opinion modifiers from being applied (credit to @Toa Kraka for the report).
		Fixed several instances of vanilla's type of *Administration* laws being referenced when EMF's set of *Administration* laws should have been referenced instead (in imported vanilla code).


EMF 6.04 [2016-11-17]
	*CHANGES:*
		Fertility:
			Characters now have a small chance of being born with hidden traits that alter their fertility: *Fertile* (previously existed but is now hidden), *Infertile* (the opposite of *Fertile* -- simply less fertile than normal), and *Sterile* (starts hidden but can be revealed). You will not know you have them and will not know if, say, the character you intend to marry has them.
			It's possible for characters, when sick or when giving birth, to reduce their "rank" of fertility (e.g., *Fertile* is removed, or *Infertile* becomes *Sterile*).
			A married woman who has no children and is sterile might begin to suspect that she is barren, which will present the option of attempting to "treat" her condition. Treatment might remove the hidden *Sterile* trait (replacing it with merely *Infertile*) but also has a chance of making her sick, injuring her, or even killing her. Hopefully, her husband learns nothing of these endeavours, but of course, there is a chance that he will.
			A husband who has been married for more than three years without a pregnancy may become suspicious, receiving the option to have their physician or lord spiritual investigate. This might:
				Uncover the hidden sterility of either marriage partner (revealing the previously hidden *Sterile* trait).
				Piss off his wife, of course!
				Make her sick or even permanently reduce her Health.
			If secretly sterile characters have been married/consorts for more than five years, rumors may spread and also reveal their previously hidden *Sterile* trait.
		Factions:
			When rulers are invited to join an upcoming civil war and choose to do so, they will now immediately join the correct faction in order to participate in the war as a rebel. Similarly, players no longer need to manually join a faction after pledging to the rebel side; that is now automatic.
		Multiplayer:
			The *Grant County (Administrator)* and *Grant County (Military Governor)* title decisions now, like their singleplayer counterpart (*Grant County*), require either 25 gold or an eighth of your current yearly income, whichever is greater, if the province in question does not already match both your culture and religion. [Appointing a local governor is free.]
		Automatic Empire Disintegration:
			[SWMH] The HRE's minimum realm size requirement to avoid AED when it has less than *High Crown Authority* has been reduced to 250 holdings from 300.
			Improved robustness of search for an allowed fallback kingdom title as well as the handling of vassal king independence when empire has *Imperial* or *al-Mulk* government type.
		Plots:
			You may no longer plot to revoke baronies in your capital county; we recently added this, but we've since decided that mechanism isn't appropriate for what we wanted to achieve. If the ability to do this returns, it will work differently.
			Switching to the Intrigue screen should now have significantly reduced lag/delay in some circumstances.
			More unavailable plots are now no longer shown at all (so not even a failed tooltip), primarily in cases where they could never realistically become available.
			The tooltip for the *Plot to Gain Vassal Title* is now even more clear and succinct in its summary of the cases which the plot allows.
			You may now plot to revoke vassal kings' titular kingdom titles if you like, although with current EMF rules regarding titular kingdoms, this doesn't come up much; it likely will again in the future, however.
		(Reaper's Due) *Shut The Gates!* decision now only becomes available when an epidemic is actually nearby your capital rather than anywhere at all within your independent realm.
		Tributaries are no longer automatically released when their suzerain dies if they are still valid targets for a tributary CB (e.g., still neighboring realms). They're given the option to either continue their tributary status or refuse to be bound by it. If they refuse, their suzerain may decide to immediately launch a war to force them back into line.
		*Protected Council Appointments* law now requires the Conclave DLC.
	*MINOR:*
		(Reaper's Due) *Invite to Build Hospital* targeted decision (used on holy order grandmasters to allow them to construct a castle in your capital in exchange for a free hospital) now properly precludes making such deals with holy orders you've already expelled (vanilla oversight).
		Merged vanilla's new *Ask To Leave Court* targeted decision with EMF's preexisting *Banish From Court* targeted decision.
		[Vanilla Map] Wladyslaw I Herman of Poland no longer starts in 1066 with the *Infirm* trait. We figured that *Frail* was a more appropriate representation of his ailment. As a result, this historical character finally has a decent chance at becoming "King" of Poland, as is historical.
		The scale of city sprawl on-map models has been reduced by -25%.
	*FIXES:*
		Mongol Invasion:
			Fixed issue preventing scripted invasion AI from functioning (and proper event troops being spawned) in bookmarks after 1217.
			Fixed issue which could cause invasion's initial war to succeed but still fail to actually usurp a title in order for the Mongols to become landed.
			Added robust retry logic for invasion's initial war if it neither succeeds nor fails for some reason (e.g., if it gets invalidated) -- as much an enhancement as it is a "fix."
		[SWMH] Zaydi religion now has proper names for God, as it did in plain EMF.
		Educating a child while the Groom an Heir ambition is active should now prompt the child to get more than just the Ambitious trait.
		The tournament-ending event no longer fires if the tournament has been previously cancelled by war or death.
		(Reaper's Due) No more Isis-cultured Court Physicians named Adam.
		Fixed a title history issue with the *Form the Saint-Empire Romain* decision which would not show the initial holder of the restored empire (due to a 2.6.X change).
		Fixed a number of uses of "is_voter = yes" which were meant to identify a councillor but which don't work if you don't have the Conclave DLC active.


EMF 6.03 [2016-10-25]
	*CHANGES:*
		Laws:
			The *Crown Authority* sub-laws *Internal King's Peace* and *Complete King's Peace* now require a minimum of *Absolute Crown Authority* before they can be enacted. The former must still be enacted before the latter, respectively.
			(Conclave DLC) The *Title Revocation* demesne law will now be automatically reduced whenever primary title *Crown Authority* is reduced below the law settings' respective minimum CA requirements, similar to the way in which the CA sub-laws *King's Peace* and *Protected Inheritance* are capped by CA.
			(Conclave DLC) The *Title Revocation* law now applies a temporary 10-year opinion malus (-15) upon raising the law setting, just like the other *Crown Authority* sub-laws.
			The maximum liege levy bonuses of *High Crown Authority* and *Absolute Crown Authority* have been removed, although the minimum liege levy bonuses (and demesne cap bonuses) remain the same.
		(Conclave DLC) King-tier vassals may now join or create factions conspiring against their liege regardless of whether they're on their liege's council, how much power the council has, or whether it's discontent.
		Mercenary companies which usurp land will now lose their mercenary title after five years (provided they are at peace).
		Employment decisions now produce less overpowered courtiers (though they still have a chance of producing a good one), have a minimum cost, and may now be used only once every three months.
		Decisions to convert to local culture/religion can now be taken regardless of whether you're independent or [do not] have a liege of the same culture/religion. Prestige costs of doing so have been lowered, and in the case of religion, so has the piety reward. [These decisions are not allowed for the AI; they use separate mechanics.]
		The *Become Saoshyant* decision now requires controlling all counties in the 'Persia and Mesopotamia' region with both the vanilla and SWMH maps.
	*FIXES:*
		The settlement decision for converting a tribal holding to a castle, city, or temple holding should now work again.
		The EMF Crier module, which among other things does flavorful-mechanical announcements of sacrificed religious heads, now works again with the new sacrificial death reasons added in 2.6 / Reaper's Due.
		Some tweaks done to the events which prompt Seljuk's appearance, so there's less chance of something invalidating the event chain.
		No more *Famous Beauty* horses.
		Fixed some vanilla issues in prosperity events.


EMF 6.02 [2016-10-12]
	*MAJOR:*
		Compatibility patch with Crusader Kings II v2.6.2
		Tournaments:
			All major tournaments have been merged to use the same file (with different text and pictures, based on the type).
			Nomad Wargames now use the tournament system, in addition to the regular Grand Tournaments and Furusiyyas - the main difference is that they are cheaper and only have a single winner (instead of top three).
			Independent dukes may now hold Grand Tournaments and Furusiyyas as well as kings and emperors.
			All tournament types may be held once every ten years. They are canceled by war and if the ruler holding the tournament dies.
			The cost of a tournament is now variable, with regular tournaments being 200 Wealth or a year's income, whichever is higher (Nomad Wargames are 50 Wealth or 6 months income).
			All members of a ruler's realm will be invited to a tournament, and they can choose to take part in the fighting (if they are eligible) or they can spectate. This includes the ruler who called for the tournament. Women are allowed to fight in the tournament if they are eligible to be marshals (or would be if they were vassals, in the case of independent rulers). Spectators receive the same update on fights occurring during the tournament as a fighter, and they have a different group of events they are eligible to receive.
			Updates on the tournament fights include not only who was wounded/killed but also who wounded/killed them.
			All those attending a tournament have a chance of becoming ill from the crowds, with a greater chance for those who spectate rather than fight.
			An event chain will pick the 'beauty of the realm' attending the tournament, if one is present, and she will receive the *Famous Beauty* trait. Former beauties will lose their trait and may become jealous.
			Tournament romances between those who fight and those who spectate are fairly common, and there is an entire chain devoted to them.
		Mongol Empire:
			When the Mongol Empire reaches a certain size (enough to allow for fair-sized successor empires) and the current Khagan dies, it will split into three different realms -- with the heirs assuming new dynasties and abandoning claims in the other realms. Now, it is finally possible for the Golden Horde, il-Khanate, and the Chagatai Khanate (renamed to Moghul Khanate if no member of the Chagatayid dynasty forms it) to dynamically form and for Genghis's dynasty to break up into the houses of Jochi, Tolui, Ogedei, and Chagatai.
			The Mongol invasion AI code has been further tuned to improve the pace of invasion and general menace of the Mongols while also ensuring more plausible invasion targets and reducing the potential for border gore during the invasion itself. This helps promote cleaner, more desirable outcomes for the aforementioned Mongol Empire split mechanic.
			When Temujin spawns, many more of his historical relatives are spawned as well.
		Tribal Holdings:
			Tribal rulers will occasionally get pious courtiers asking for help to build a temple in one of their demesne provinces, help which can come in the form of wealth, piety, or prestige (but which is considerably cheaper than building the temple on one's own). Building can take up to twenty years or more, provided no events occur which delay the process. Should the pious courtier die or otherwise become invalid, the ruler can appoint another valid courtier to take their place.
			Tribal rulers can now use the *Settle Province* job (replacing *Settle Tribe*) on demesne provinces of their own culture to attempt to build a city there. Once the steward finds a suitable spot, construction on the city can take up to ten years provided no events occur to delay or derail the process.
	*CHANGES:*
		Game Rules:
			Rule *No Extra CB Cooldowns* replaces the customization decision *No CB Cooldowns*.
			Rule *Republic CB Restrictions* partially replaces the customization *Rules for Merchant Republics*; the latter's functionality regarding unlocking higher levels of Crown Authority than *Limited Crown Authority* has been dropped.
		Economy:
			Castle, city, and temple construction technologies now award only an extra 4% tax generation from their holding type per tech level (caps at 32%) instead of the 6.25%/level in vanilla (caps at 50%).
			Buildings now cost a further +30% across the board.
			Gavelkind no longer confers any additional bonus to demesne size beyond the vanilla +30% (used to be +50%).
			[SWMH] Demesne size limits have been reset to vanilla (and plain EMF). While vanilla does tend to have a higher value per province than SWMH *depending upon the region*, it doesn't call for an across-the-board demesne cap bonus.
			[SWMH] Tribal holding tax modifier for each empty holding slot in its province reduced from 70% per empty slot to the vanilla 50%.
			The base levy maintenance cost factor has been significantly reduced, although it is still higher than vanilla. This is primarily to allow the tribal AI to avoid auto-bankruptcy whenever they raid. Note that this change unfortunately affects non-tribals as well, as there is no way to separate the two groups' maintenance directly. Note that there are future plans to address this toward the end of furthering EMF's goals for war difficulty and realism.
		Religious Tweaks:
			Waldensians no longer receive an inherent +2 Sterwardship.
			Paulicians no longer receive intrinsic morale bonuses for their levies.
			Zealots may only be raised by Paulicians and Kharijites once every three months rather than once a month.
			Cathar Perfecti may no longer be Spymasters or Marshals (or lead armies).
			The *Invite Holy Man to Court* decision now has a chance of recruiting a woman if your religion is feminist. It also recruits a monk or nun for most Christian faiths, a perfecti for Cathars and Bogomilists, and a desert father or desert mother for Coptics and Monophysites.
			Characters who commit suicide are no longer permitted to become saints.
		Nomads:
			Nomad stewards may now use the *Settle Province* job (replacing *Settle Tribe*) to change province culture in your demesne.
			Nomads' clan limit has been reduced to the vanilla 9 from 12.
			[SWMH] Nomadic vassal clans are now satisfied with fewer provinces per clan, because SWMH has far more historical clans per khaganate than vanilla, and this has dogged the efficacy of historical nomadic realms as well as led to the quick extinction of many of those historical clans once the game is actually unpaused with so many khaganates far over their clan limit.
				Now, virtually no nomadic realms should already be over their clan limit at the start of the game. Expect to see some significantly different outcomes on the steppes than you may have grown accustomed.
		Dynamic Mercenaries:
			Some adjustment to AI willingness to make close relatives mercenary leaders -- they'll tend to only send those who are actually militarily-inclined.
			Women can now be made dynamic mercenary leaders if they are also permitted to lead armies.
		The *3rd-Party Claim* CB-- used for pressing the claims of those under you-- has new vassal rank restrictions regarding whether they'll remain your vassal after the war is successful. To review as well as illustrate this change, any one of the following conditions is sufficient for the claimant to become/remain your landed vassal after such a war, provided that your own rank is higher than the target title:
			You are of the same dynasty as the claimant.
			You are the de jure liege of the target title.
			The claimant is already a vassal ruler (either directly or indirectly), AND:
				(NEW) Their rank is no less than one rank below that of the target title. E.g., as an emperor pressing a vassal's claim for a kingdom, the vassal must already be of duke- or king-tier to remain your vassal after the war. It will not suffice to grant a courtier claimant a barony or county in this case.
		Automatic Empire Disintegration:
			Now checks all special title creation requirements upon potential fallback kingdoms before selecting one to be given to the soon-to-be-demoted Emperor. [It has always checked the minimum de jure territory requirements.]
			Now lists any king-tier vassals that would go independent as a result of the title destruction, and in the process, fixes a potential source of game state coherency issues due to a 2.6 bug related to title destruction that breaks vassal-liege relationships.
		Requests to a liege to transfer dejure vassals may now be made once per year, although the AI will do it only once every five years.
		Added a Bogomilist Imperial government for parity with the non-Bogomilist Imperial and Muslim al-Mulk governments.
		*History's Forgotten Daughters* now applies at all start dates (not just prior to 1066).
		Recruiting vassals into a Court, Prosperity, Glory, or Tradition faction will now take effect instantly. Players may now be recruited as well, if they choose, and do not need to manually join the faction.
		Balanced some of EMF's unique congenital traits (those once integrated from VIET Traits) and adjusted them so that they'll appear more often.
		Base provincial supply limits have been slightly lowered.
		Claimant faction is now much less likely to support rulers outside their independent realm.
	*FIXES:*
		[MAJOR] Tribal players will no longer default to *Tanistry Succession* (unless within the Celtic culture group).
		The Magyar migration CB should not invalidate any longer if you occupy all the target's provinces in the eastern carpathian region.
		The *Change a Province's Culture* ambition should now also succeed if culture changes due to the new prosperity event chain or through the Magyar migration.
		The previous release's neato new feature regarding bishop selection for performing coronations now actually works [bishops sequentially ask to perform the ceremony in a rational order of importance to you]. A bug was preventing any bishop selection from happening at all.
		Maronites may now go on pilgrimage. Tondrakians will now go to Constantinople rather than Axum.
		Absorbing nomad clans should now result in a proper attempt to overthrow the khan again.
		Removed erroneous crusade tooltip which mentioned claimants getting the crusade title.
		Fixed a case where a poorly-translated bible could result in massive MA adjustments to Christian faiths.
		Fixed an issue wherein de jure emperors usurping secondary de jure empires could theoretically lead to a [slow] cycle of pointless secondary empire usurpation & destruction due to EMF's "one emperor, one empire" mechanic (thanks to @Toa Kraka for pointing this out).
		Jihads should now be eligible to begin before Christian crusades are valid.
		Immortals will no longer lose swordsmanship skill due to advanced age.
		Despot minor title can now still be handed out even when the Conclave DLC isn't active.
		Removed an old event from Project Balance that was blank regarding the return of Benevento to the King of Sicily.
		The Catholic and Orthodox faiths will no longer be able to emancipate their religions after the schism has been mended.
		The emancipation decision now works if the parent religion head is a player - it now permits that player to decide whether a crusade will be called.


EMF 6.01 [2016-09-06]
	*MAJOR:*
		(Vanilla Map) EU4 Conversion Supported
			EMF+Vanilla (EMF without SWMH) game conversion to Europa Universalis 4 via the Converter DLC should now be more correct than ever.
			All EMF-unique religious, cultural, and government type setup is now supported for conversion.
			While we were at it, we incorporated the mod Vanilla Converter Fixes v0.8 with permission from and credit to @tkamin (see: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/mod-converter-vanilla-converter-fixes.871522/).
	*CHANGES:*
		Coronations:
			Coronation event text will now mention the performing bishop, if there is one.
			Vassals of neighboring realms are no longer invited to a coronation - they are either in the same realm as the ruler being coronated or they are independent.
			The bishop performing a royal/imperial coronation is no longer random. Five days after invitations are sent out, bishops will begin asking to perform the ceremony - beginning with the religion head (if invited) and moving down through the ranks by tier, friends/relatives, and then baron-tier bishops first in the ruler's capital and then elsewhere in their realm. Only one such request fires each day until the coronation is performed (and they stop the moment you accept one).
		Fighter & Diplomacy Traits:
			Fighter training now does not start until age 6 (rather than age 5).
			Added more checks to adjust the time it takes for a child to increase their training skill.
			Once a child levels up in either Fighter or Diplomat training, they will not do so for at least another year.
			Female children do not receive Fighter training unless they are eligible to lead armies.
			Female children do not receive Diplomat training unless they are eligible to be chancellors or are independent rulers.
			Educators are now increasingly better at training children the higher their own Fighter or Diplomat skill is.
			Chancellors can slowly increase their Diplomat skill over time.
			Fighter skill can now decrease more than one level after age 45, but after it decreases it won't decrease again for another 10 years at least.
		The *Become a Saint* ambition should now take longer to complete, and there will be far fewer AI characters who attempt it and succeed (and thus fewer saints being declared overall).
		The *Become King* ambition will no longer be selected by rulers that are outright disqualified from creating their capital kingdom title (due to special creation requirements, which are present at least in some form for every kingdom title), if it is not already held by another ruler.
		When a player ruler dies, their successor will immediately have their current focus and ambition cleared, if any.
		Within the first year after a player's succession, the focus of any of their children who are in their court may be cleared once via the new *Clear Childhood Focus* diplo-decision.
		Military:
			Increased raised-levy maintenance cost factor a bit (from a factor of 2.2 to 2.5).
			Slightly decreased warscore-worth of normal battles (from a multiplier of 1.33 to 1.25).
			Significantly increased warscore-worth of battles that are part of a crusade/jihad/GHW (now vanilla) or a duchy adventure or similar (higher than vanilla).
		One may no longer plot to fabricate a claim upon their liege's primary title if it is king-tier or higher.
		Gaining a claim on an Imperial throne can no longer be done by mercenaries or holy orders, and the claimant must now be of the emperor's religion.
	*FIXES:*
		*Recently Acquired* modifier has been changed back to the proper hourglass icon.
		Fixed one Imperial courtiers event where you could become a friend of the wrong courtier.
		When a character dies due to health complications from dwarfism, the death reason should now be localised as such (instead of just 'death_dwarf').
		Fixed vanilla omission of the *Caliphal Subjugation* CB with regard to the new "when launching a war adds a major cooldown or costs a lot of piety, it will be removed/refunded if the war invalidates" practice.
		[SWMH] Great Moravia is no longer rendered titular upon formation of the HRE to avoid the 2.6.1.1 "anybody can usurp titular titles, including AI" bug.


EMF 6.0 [2016-09-03]
	Compatibility patch with Crusader Kings II v2.6 [WIP]
	*OTHER CHANGES:*
		Some Customization Decisions Converted to Game Rules:
			Game rule *Ahistorical De Jure Empires* replaces decisions *Add Ahistorical Empires* and *Remove Ahistorical Empires*.
			Game rule *Gender Equality* replaces same-named customization decision.
		*Agnatic Succession* is now the baseline default gender succession law rather than *Agnatic-Cognatic Succession*. The ERE (top empire title only) and titles with holders of the culture Occitan or the culture group Iberian after the year 1000 will still default to *Agnatic-Cognatic* succession, and any titles scripted via history to have particular gender succession laws will override these defaults.
		The *Invasion* CB (such as that used by William the Conqueror in the 1066 bookmark) now sets the succession law of the target title to that of the attacker's primary title upon success. Also, all new vassals of the attacker will be subjugated for 10 years (and thus unable to join factions against their new liege).
		(Reaper DLC only) Adjusted the chances of symptoms turning into serious illnesses (healthy characters become seriously ill less often, weak characters more often), and adjusted the chances of some illnesses such as gout and cancer to be less common.
	*FIXES:*
		Missing Zaydi holy sites added and religion description updated to reflect non-heresy status.
		Congenital trait inheritance from grandparents now more robust and properly reflects the traits of newborns' real fathers, if different from their effective father.


EMF 5.09 [2016-08-22]
	*MAJOR:*
		Better Magyars:
			The Magyars now begin the TOG bookmark as tribal rather than nomadic. They also no longer begin with event troops, nor do they begin at war with Bulgaria.
			When (and if) the Magyars are reduced in their holdings, they may eventually decide to migrate across the Carpathian mountains - provided there is a valid target there, with lands immediately on the other side of the mountain ridge. The Magyars immediately receive their event troops, and the target realm must then decide whether or not to let the lands go to the migrating horde, or whether to fight them. If they elect to fight, a war is started immediately, and if won by the Magyars will have the same effect as if they were peacefully permitted to cross: they usurp all lands of the target's realm in de jure k_hungary and all their provinces outside of de jure k_hungary will individually lose their Magyar culture, become tribal, and go independent. Former Magyar vassals are absorbed into the liege's court and will ask for a county in the new homeland.
			A player Magyar realm has access to a *Cross the Carpathians* decision instead, useable prior to 920 so long as they have not grown in size or converted away from Tengri and there is a valid target on the other side of the Carpathians as with the event chain, which immediately starts a war as if the target had refused (so they always have to fight in order to migrate).
			Avar provinces owned by Magyar rulers will convert to Hungarian culture much more quickly.
			(SWMH only) If the Magyar realm is large enough, certain Avar provinces in the realm will convert to Szekely culture instead, and will spawn a number of Szekely courtiers when they do.
			AI Magyars are much less likely to convert away from paganism prior to settling.
			Prior to becoming non-pagan, Magyars will now produce far more raiders once they've crossed the mountains into Carpathia. They also have access to a Magyar Raid casus belli, useable to force the target and the owners of all occupied provinces/baronies to pay the victor, though this is useable only after a Magyar realm has conquered most of de jure Hungary (an event will fire to announce it).
			Once the Magyars become feudal, their original event troops (if not already lost) will be removed, and the AI will be prompted to become Catholic (if it is still Tengri).
			The *Create Hungary* decision has been removed. Player Magyar realms will need to feudalize and form the Kingdom of Hungary normally. The tribal Magyar title is destroyed if ever owned in conjunction with the Kingdom of Hungary title.
		Decadence Redefined (an ongoing evolution):
			Decadence is the misgovernance of a ruling dynasty due to corruption, incompetence, and/or apostasy.
			Dynastic decadence is now strictly dependent upon dynasty members within the same (sub-)realm.
				The "realm dynasty head" is any ruler who has no liege of their dynasty in the realm above them (regardless of whether they're independent).
				Realm dynasty heads are responsible for convincing decadent dynasty members in their subrealm to "straighten-up," and it is they who will receive the tiered "Decadent Dynasty" traits depending upon their dynasty's realm decadence rating.
				The "official" [global] dynasty head (i.e., the guy shown in the upper-right corner of the Religion window's decadent relative listing) is now otherwise irrelevant. Unfortunately, due to modding limitations, note that we cannot instead show the portrait of the *realm dynasty head* (if different) in the Religion window.
			The dynastic decadence rating is no longer a simple function of a few flat thresholds of decadent dynasty member counts; instead, the *proportion* of decadent realm dynasty members is now critical.
				This means that large dynasties are no longer doomed to highly-decadent status, because the rating scales with the realm dynasty's size. Likewise, small realm dynasties will suffer more than otherwise from fewer amounts of decadent relatives.
				With the shift to the "misgovernance" model of decadence and the advent of these scaled decadence ratings, we now also weight the decadence (or lack thereof) of dynasty members by rank / influence.
					A decadent duke matters more to the realm dynasty rating than a decadent count, who in turn matters more than a decadent baron, who in turn matters more than a decadent courtier.
					This works both ways, so, e.g., several non-decadent higher-tier rulers will significantly outweigh the importance of an equal number of decadent courtiers toward their realm's dynastic decadence rating.
			If the realm dynasty head himself is also decadent, his realm's decadence rating is effectively +50%!
			With this new definition of decadence, certain traits now have different impacts upon decadence:
				The *Content* and *Ambitious* traits are no longer relevant.
				The *Homosexual* trait is no longer relevant. While it'd certainly be apostate in the eyes of Muslims in the Middle Ages, such a private status on its own doesn't imply a negative impact upon right governance.
			Nomads are no longer subject to the EMF decadence mechanic. Neither are rulers of landless titles such as mercenary bands or holy orders.
			When a character becomes *Decadent*, all same-dynasty players in the subrealm of their realm dynasty head are now notified in addition to the realm dynasty head.
	*CHANGES:*
		New title decision: *Renounce Claim*
			Occasionally, you'll have a claim to a title that you do not actually want. For a quick relations boost with the title holder (if any), you may now renounce that claim by right-clicking a CoA for the title (i.e., the same way all title decisions are accessed, and for claims, you can do this straight from your own character view since the shields of all your claims are displayed there) and choosing *Renounce Claim*.
		New title decision: *Grant County*
			Sometimes, the *Grant Recently Acquired Land* decision is not available when you need it. The title decision *Grant County* will allow you to grant any non-capital county (and any subholdings which you own in it) to a new steward or military governor either of your own culture and religion or of the local provincial culture and religion.
			NOTE: In multiplayer, we instead feature 1-click *Grant County (Administrator)* or *Grant County (Military Governor)* title decisions, and there is no option to grant to a character of the local provincial culture and religion -- only of your own. This is due to a long-running CK2 multiplayer OoS (Out of Sync) limitation related to chained events which grant titles to new characters.
		Buildings are now +20% more expensive across the board.
		Plots:
			Plots to gain vassal titles now show easy-to-understand tooltips for why they are (or aren't) available
			Rulers may now plot to revoke vassals' barony titles inside their capital county
			Emperors may now plot to revoke vassals' de jure kingdom titles when the vassal has none of the kingdom's de jure counties in his subrealm
		Islam:
			Muslims holding Muslim provinces now suffer a -10% provincial tax modifier, as in vanilla; they have the jizya bonus in non-Muslim provinces, as always.
			[SWMH] Reduced the Muslim levy size handicap to +25% (from +35%)
			The Arsiyah (Sunni holy order) now forms shortly after Muslim Jihads are unlocked, regardless of any territorial conditions.
			Zaydi is no longer a Shi'ite heresy, but it is instead a separate faith within the Muslim religion group.
			The Furusiyyah event texts and effects have been updated to reflect new decadence mechanics and offer some fresh flavor.
			The Bektashi Order is now Isma'ili rather than Sunni for historical reasons. A new Sunni holy order will be added, although they still have the Arsiyah on their side.
			Shuffled the display order for *Obligations* & *Focus* demesne laws to be more relevant for all religion groups (particularly relevant to Muslims).
		Event chains & decisions upgraded to use EMF's new messages-tab-only trait gain/loss notification system (with some vanilla bugfixes along the way):
			Conclave's adolescence education events (e.g., when childhood traits manifest as adult traits)
			Events associated with the [Conclave] ambition *Groom Heir*
			Childhood advancement of personal combat or diplomatic traits
			Hajj events
			Muslim *Compose an Epic Poem* event chain
		If a non-nomadic emperor acquires a secondary empire title by whatever means, they'll now be forced to choose which one to keep -- there can only be one legitimate empire title under a single emperor.
			The empire not chosen will be destroyed without penalty.
			No "de jure merge" of the titles happens automatically; they must de jure drift normally.
			The AI will always choose to keep their original empire title (for ease of understanding its behavior, largely).
				Exception: If the AI can upgrade from a titular empire to a de jure empire, it will always do so.
		Imperial Decay:
			Imperial Decay for any given empire title is now capped at 100% (80-100% gives maximum malus). It can also never be negative now.
			In an effort to help users better understand how their Imperial Decay rating is changing, *all* changes to an empire's Imperial Decay rating, for any reason, are notified to the emperor with the new rating and the amount by which it changed (positive or negative).
			The decay gain calculations upon an empire title changing hands are now much more fine-grained, and the formulas for various factors' contribution to decay change now exhibit more desirable, non-linear response curves.
				[SWMH] The realm size component of decay gain upon succession (usually the largest of them all) has been calibrated for typical SWMH realm sizes (our rule of thumb is 8 holdings on SWMH for every 5 on vanilla).
			If a secondary empire title is acquired, the emperor will need to choose which title to keep (see above). If he chooses to assume the newer empire title, the Imperial Decay of whichever title has higher decay will be used.
				Previously, multiple empire titles were not handled correctly, and inherited/usurped secondary empires with higher decay would "infect" the decay rating of all other, held imperial titles unconditionally-- and they would do so again upon every succession. Now, the higher decay is assumed only once and only in the case of choosing to keep the new empire title.
			Emperors subject to the Imperial Decay mechanic are now also penalized in the levy size of any demesne temples they may hold (particularly relevant to Iqta, al-Mulk, and Bogomilist governments).
		Independence Faction:
			AI HRE/SER vassals in Italy/Burgundy now consider themselves [fully] de jure before 1125. Previously, they considered themselves "partially" de jure, and there was no expiration.
			AI vassals whose subrealm provinces are fully part of an exclave(s) are now much more likely to join/create the faction. Province exclave status requires no transitive connectivity to the liege's capital within the top realm.
		History's Forgotten Daughters:
			In bookmarks prior to 1066, AI rulers over the age of 30 who do not already have any female children will have a chance of having one or two random adult daughters created for them. Muslims, pagans, and rulers of higher rank will have a greater chance of this occurring. These daughters are not created for rulers where the daughters will have any chance of inheriting their title.
		Vanilla Seljuk-spawning event has been cleaned up and will now likely fire more often.
		Vanilla Timur-spawning event has been cleaned up and will now likely fire more often.
		Vanilla Sabuktigin-spawning event has been cleaned up and will now likely fire more often and will now actually work with SWMH - and will not be used at all with mini-SWMH.
		[SWMH] Oghuz-culture rulers will slowly change to Turkmen culture if they cease to be nomadic (players can opt out of this and their vassals will never switch).
		[SWMH] Turkmen-culture rulers will slowly change to Turkish culture after 1200 if they are in the Asia Minor region (players can opt out of this and their vassals will never switch).
		The *Center of Trade* building tree for cities which predominantly provided tech points and tax has been removed.
		[SWMH] Added a levy size & levy reinforcement rate handicap of +25% and +25%, respectively (same as Muslims), to the Zoroastrian and Jewish religion groups as well as to Coptic, Apostolic, Nestorian, Maronite, Paulician, and their respective heresies. [Same reason as Muslims: on SWMH, their parts of the map are more holding- and province-sparse than the [rest of the] Christian world, and this is a balance measure.]
		The Mongol Empire (and Aztec Empire) now enjoy +30 vassal limit but suffer -15 opinion from non-nomadic, non-tribal vassals.
		Tournaments can now be held up to once every 10 years by the same ruler (previously had a lifetime cooldown).
		Minimum number of years to de jure drift a duchy into a different de jure kingdom reverted to vanilla's 100 years (was 75 for awhile).
		[SWMH] Dynamic de jure expansion of Christian Iberian kingdoms (due to successful Reconquista) can now happen when their holder is a vassal king instead of only when independent.
		Piety threshold to qualify for sainthood upped considerably for religion heads and non-rulers.
		To use the *Pagan Subjugation* CB, the attacker must now be at least duke-tier.
		New icons for *Plot to Embezzle*, *Plot to Fabricate Heresy*, *Plot to Fabricate Treason*, the *Rebel* / *Neutral* / *Loyalist* traits, for Bogomilist feudal government, Imperial government, and al-Mulk government.
		*Prove Your Rule* decision now useable by the Roman Empire as well as the Byzantine Empire.
	*MINOR CHANGES:*
		The opinion malus for 'Wrong Government Form' has been reduced to -10 from -20.
		The opinion bonus for 'Marriage Ties' has been increased from +15 to +20.
		The AI will not seek to claim the imperial throne in Imperial realms if its liege opinion is 80 or more.
		The text for the event which fires when a viceroy loses their title will no longer mention the former owner passing if they're still alive.
		AI will no longer seek to change *Clergy Obligations* law if they lack any clergy vassals (particularly relevant for Muslims).
		Fewer AI characters will attempt the *Become a Saint* ambition or succeed at it.
		The nickname 'the Usurper' should now be given about half as often as previously, and it will no longer be given to "usurpers" that have already held the title in the past.
	*FIXES:*
		The nickname 'the Treacherous' is no longer misspelled.
		*King's De Jure Claim* (i.e., third-party de jure county claims of vassal kings) no longer redundantly show as valid CBs when the de jure kingdom holder is also the emperor.
		Added trait icon for *Hurufi Diwan*.
		The 'Medium' setting of *Iqta Obligations* law is now properly called *Medium Iqta Obligations* rather than just the mysterious *Medium* law.
		Educator notification of childhood diplomatic trait advancement no longer shows tooltips related to personal combat trait advancement.
		(Vanilla Map) The Hashshashin are now properly Isma'ili instead of Shi'ite.
		A few revolt CBs still allowed the defender (liege before war) to call allies into their war. This was not our intention (particularly since patch 2.5's addition of involuntary call-to-arms but for other reasons too) and is now addressed.
		Resolved issue wherein claimant faction wars would sometimes immediately invalidate after launching.
		When forming a new Muslim cadet dynasty, the intended new dynasty name will now be used in all cases.
		Banishing a takfir can no longer give the exile any claims upon landless titles.
		The Yazidi religion head will now have a proper government type.
		[SWMH] Yazidi is no longer listed as a Sunnni heresy.


EMF 5.08 [2016-07-17]
	*MAJOR:*
		Sainthood system added:
			Added *Become a Saint* ambition, available to non-heretic Christian characters over 100 Piety (or over 1 Piety, for theocracies). This kicks off an event chain where the character will attempt to shed their negative traits, and will be much easier to achieve if they have a great deal of Piety or a large number of positive traits. Either way, ultimate success is difficult to achieve, but if they eventually do they will receive the [new] *Paragon* trait and be much more likely to be declared a saint after their death.
			Non-heretic Christian characters who are slain or executed by a member of a different religion group during an ongoing holy war may gain the *Martyr* trait, granting piety to their relatives.
			Exceptionally pious non-heretic Christian characters (this includes martyrs, kings who have converted to Christianity, and the holy men/women who converted those kings) have, upon death, a chance of being declared a saint by their religion head up to a year after death. This chance increases based on the piety and general deeds of the character. Achieving sainthood will grant piety to their living relatives as well as be announced to all members of their faith.
		New mechanics for kingdom creation tied to new crown law for empires: *De Jure Vassal Kingdom Creation*
			The *De Jure Vassal Kingdom Creation* empire crown law slider has 3 settings:
				*None* -- default for all empires, neither the emperor or any of his vassals may create imperial de jure vassal kingdom titles; if reverting back to it later from a higher law setting, it requires *Medium Crown Authority* to enact.
				*Anyone* -- both the emperor and any of his vassals are allowed to create such kingdom titles, slight vassal limit malus (-5), requires *High Crown Authority* to enact
				*Emperor* -- only the emperor and none of his vassals are allowed to create such kingdom titles, same vassal limit malus, slight feudal vassal opinion malus (-5), requires *Absolute Crown Authority* to enact
			Each change of the law costs 1500 prestige, slightly upsets any vassals or below of the emperor whom have any subrealm counties within the de jure empire (-10 opinion x 10 years), and the law may only be changed once per lifetime.
			The AI will not seek to change the law beyond *None* -- this is overall the most historical behavior, but it does mean that if you want to form de jure kingdoms as a vassal to an AI emperor, you'll have to do so outside of the de jure territory of your empire, effectively as a march. Alternatively, custom kingdoms are still allowed since they're initially titular.
			Though it's not within the CK2 timeline, consider the formation of the Kingdom of Prussia first *outside* the de jure territory of the HRE to get an idea behind the gist of this law slider's function.
			As an empire grows over time, it becomes increasingly important to be able to form vassal kingdoms; that is why the law allows player emperors to seek reform in order to deviate from the tradition of only dukes being vassal to an emperor within their de jure imperial territory. Additionally, the *Emperor* setting of the law allows for precise control over how that will be done by the emperor.
			Note that Bohemia is not subject to this law and may be created under standard conditions.
			Saves from prior versions of EMF will be automatically upgraded to the *Anyone* setting. The Byzantine Empire, however, will be automatically upgraded to the *None* setting in old saves, in keeping with the [relatively inflexible] status quo from prior versions.
			Now that this restriction is in place by default, we can finally allow AI emperors to create (and not unnecessarily destroy) kingdom titles without the issue of imperial de jure vassal kingdoms being wantonly created by the emperor.
	*CHANGES:*
		General:
			While exceeding your vassal limit will still severely degrade your tax income, it will no longer affect your available demesne and liege levies. This prevents numerous major exploits.
			Nerfed tech spread and tech points generation due to buildings as well as the static coastal tech spread modifier.
			When forming the Holy Roman Empire or Frankish HRE (Saint-Empire Romain), the stem duchy kingdoms of Lower Lorraine and Upper Lorraine will again spring into existence instead of Lotharingia lingering.
			Adventurer governments are now no longer allowed to be theocracies or republics. Like holy orders, previously, they just assumed the government form of whichever court from which they came.
		Casus Belli:
			Non-feudal rulers now comprehensively abdicate their previous titles before assuming a higher-tier feudal title via a CB.
			New CB: *3rd-Party King's De Jure County Claim*
				Emperors may now press de jure county claims for their vassal kings -- no longer just for their vassal dukes. This is a relatively rare CB opportunity, but when its need does arise, it is extremely helpful, sensible, and consistent with other Casus Belli.
				For reference, the name of the CB displayed on the UI's CB selection list takes the form "King's De Jure Claim on <TITLE>." This is intentionally a bit different than usual 3rd-party de jure ducal claim CBs, because we cannot show the portrait of the vassal king on the CB selection button as we can with those.
			The *Holy War* and *Religious Reconquest* CBs now only allow traversing sea zones to the target duchy if it can be done via a subrealm province that is transitively connected to the aggressors' top realm capital via direct province adjacencies (i.e., exclaves separated by sea zones or regular old land-separated exclaves cannot be used as basis for a holy war for a target duchy that does not directly border the aggressor subrealm).
			The *Holy War* CB no longer costs any piety to use if the attacker holds a kingdom or empire which is de jure liege or above to the target duchy.
			Better Civil War Names:
				Rather than all of the 4i faction wars, succession law faction wars, and crown authority faction wars using the same CB with the same war name (e.g., "2nd Revolt of the Byzantine Revolt League"), the main rebellion CB now has a differentiated counterpart for every type of war goal and reason for rebellion. Now, you'll see war names in-game like "2nd Byzantine Civil War to Restore Agnatic-Cognatic Succession," "3rd French Civil War for Elective Monarchy in Aquitaine," and "English Civil War to Overthrow Liege (Obligations)."
			The *Manifest Destiny Invasion* CB -- available to Seljuks and Timurids -- can no longer be used against same-dynasty targets, and the attacker must be duke- or above-tier.
		Multiplayer:
			AI lieges are no longer given a handicap with regard to 4i -- 4-interest -- faction mood assessment in multiplayer.
			All of the possible positive-mood "faction reward" events, which occur when a 4i faction votes to either support you in its faction-specific, unique way or when such a faction votes to simply offer you gold tribute, now actually work in multiplayer.
		Laws:
			*Feudal Elective Succession* no longer prevents usage of the crown authority sub-laws *Free Infidel Title Revocation*, *Complete King's Peace* (non-Conclave), and *External Inheritance Disabled*.
			Some of the 4i factions have always especially disapproved of high levels of *Crown Authority* under the HRE; now, they do so identically under the Frankish HRE (Saint-Empire Romain).
			Enacting changes to *Investiture* crown laws now has appropriate effects upon Religious Authority and temporary religious head opinion (affects Catholic, Fraticelli, Cathar, Bogomilist, and Manichean religions).
			While *Religion Head Investiture* (commonly known as 'Papal Investiture' for Catholic/Fraticelli) is still not a default law until the year 1000AD, head investiture can now be enacted at any point in time rather than only after the year 1000AD. AI will not seek to enact it any earlier than previously.
			*Crown Authority* level basic effects have been altered toward the goal of providing sufficient rewards for achieving and maintaining, e.g., *Absolute Crown Authority*:
				Minimum liege levy modifiers now range from none to +60% in +15% increments beyond *Autonomous Vassals*.
				At *High Crown Authority*, maximum liege levy is modified by +10%, and at *Absolute Crown Authority*, maximum liege levy is modified by a whopping +30%.
				At *High Crown Authority*, demesne cap is boosted by +1, and at *Absolute Crown Authority*, demesne cap is boosted by a whopping +3.
				Remember, when it comes to liege levies, the "minimum" liege levy is that which is provided at the minimum opinion at which vassals will provide any troops at all (-50), the "maximum" liege levy is that which is provided at maximum vassal opinion (100), and the realized liege levy will scale linearly between this minimum and maximum along liege opinions of -50 to 100.
			The total cost of raising *Tribal Organization* to its maximum setting has been reduced to 3500 prestige from 5000 prestige (-30%) with prestige costs steps of 500/750/1000/1250.
		Military:
			Characters' martial skill now directly influences their army morale: the impact is scaled by the martial attribute value, so 10 martial = +4% morale, 15 martial = +6% morale, 20 = +8% morale (a linear curve of land_morale = 0.004*M, where M is martiall skill level).
			[SWMH] The dynamic levies (i.e., "dynlevy") min/max liege levy law modifier increments (of which there are 64) which scale with ruler realm size (number of holdings in subrealm) have been modified to allow the law's [nonlinear] scaling curve to stretch from realm sizes of less than 24 with no malus to realm sizes of at least 520 for maximum malus (-50%). This penalizes medium-sized realms less than currently and applies more relative penalty to very large realms like the HRE.
		Temples / Bishroprics / Mosques:
			Temples have been made *significantly* more attractive from a base tax, base levy/garrison, and levy reinforcement rate perspective. Base city levy reinforcement rates have been halved, in contrast.
			The temple military building tree has been modified to produce a strong heavy infantry + pikemen combination well-supported by archers.
		Holy Orders:
			The Saqaliba are now an Isma'ili holy order instead of Shi'ite (along with the Hashshashin, which had already been converted to Isma'ili).
			The Arsiyah's events & decisions have been updated to trigger off the appropriate new Sunni heresies (introduced a few releases ago with the new religious setup), should they take-over Sunni and become non-heretic.
			The Hashshashin / Assassins formation code now uses the historical founding character of Hassan i-Sabbah if he's alive at the time of formation.
			(EMF+Vanilla) The Hashshashin now properly consider EMF's custom decadence mechanic when choosing assassination targets (was already true for EMF+SWMH).
			General audit for consistency across all holy order code, which resulted in reversal of some unintended behavior.
			Whenever any holy order is created, a standard set of effects are now applied (some were the case for certain orders, some others, some not at all-- the vanilla setup is quite inconsistent). Some of the more important, new effects:
				Ensure that they have the correct kind of feudal government for their religion. Previously, holy orders had the government type of whichever ruler happened to run the event which spawned them (essentially random, but usually feudal). This led to theocracy holy orders, republican holy orders, etc., and that was certainly not ideal.
				If their religion's Religious Authority is less than 75%, then add a 10-year RA modifier of +5% to their religion.
		Religion:
			Becoming a Messalian Master is now more difficult: it requires a period of prayer and fasting just the same as driving out daemons, and only offers a chance of success (with the chance higher depending on the level of Piety for the character). A 250 Piety cost is incurred when beginning the prayer, and the character must wait at least three years before they can attempt it again.
			Becoming a Messalian Master now only raises Religious Authority of the Messalian faith if it is currently below 75%.
			The reward event for the *Convert a Province* ambition is back and has been improved significantly, including the first usage of EMF's new notification-tab-only trait gain/loss notification system.
			For a heresy to overtake its parent religion via the classic SoA heresy takeover mechanic, the heretic religion now requires 10 provinces more than the parent rather than 5. [In 1066+ starts, Zaydi was frequently taking-over Shi'ite by default due to the recent legitimization of Isma'ili.]
			The *Court Anarchy* trait is no longer inherited by the next Sunni caliph when starting from the Old Gods bookmark.
			Muslims should now be more aggressive, and they enjoy 2 *Military Organization* technology levels' worth of additional retinue cap, although their retinue maintenance cost remains the same.
			[SWMH] Total levy sizes and levy reinforcement rate for Muslims has been boosted a bit to counterbalance the fact that the Muslim world is very holding- and province-sparse compared to Europe on SWMH.
	*MINOR CHANGES:*
		The *Fabricate Heresy* plot is no longer useable on actual heretics and invalidates if the target becomes one.
		The new *Revassalize* CB now lasts 50 years instead of 40 (provided that the ex-vassal doesn't die first).
		The notification of Imperial Decay at the beginning of the game now uses the player's portrait rather than Isis's portrait.
		The effect tooltip for passing a succession law change will now warn you when doing so would leave you with net negative prestige.
		New icons for *Go Crusade*, *Go Jihad*, *Become a Saint*, *Become Regent*, and *Plot to Kidnap*
		Maintaining a mercenary band (Zeus, HL) now has a smaller negative impact upon demesne levy size.
		Ramadan events & decisions optimized a bit and no longer show positive/negative decadence effects when they can't actually have an effect.
	*FIXES:*
		Several of the new plots now properly take into account the plotter's Plot Power when calculating the chance of success.
		Several vanilla fixes for the council power laws (used to result in unexpected/unfair opinion modifiers upon usurpation of titles, opinion modifiers when not actually vassal to the associated council, etc.)
		The exact rating of Imperial Decay will now always show, even if 0, on the tooltip for the *Lower Imperial Decay* decision, which is always available to be inspected
		The *3rd-Party De Jure County Claim* CB is now WAD; it was not issuing CBs when it should (for the last couple months), although the "De Jure Ducal Claims" alertbox still *listed* the CBs it should've been allowing.
		Turned off vanilla Conclave event which could apply a *Borrowed From Jews* modifier the ruler could never lose.
		If you've expelled the Saqaliba [holy order], then you can now no longer borrow money from them, as it should be.
		The *Muslim County Conquest* CB (same-religion-group variant) is now properly available, in all cases, against targets with the same liege.


EMF 5.07 [2016-06-26]
	*MAJOR*
		Intrigue Systems Update:
			An update to a number of intrigue-related systems including plots and the "Way of Life" focus actions.
				Added *Discredit Councillor* plot, useable by non-councillors with a stat of 10+ who are within 5 points of the stat held by the current councillor. If successful, the target will be ejected from the council.
				Added *Embezzle From Liege* plot, usable by members of the liege's council. If successful, it transfers money from the liege (and also rewards co-conspirators).
				Added *Fabricate Heresy* plot, useable by members of religions with a religion head that can excommunicate. If successful, the target is excommunicated.
				Added *Fabricate Treason* plot, useable on non-independent rulers with the same liege. If successful, the liege gets an opinion modifier on the target which allows imprisonment.
				Added *Kidnap* plot, allowing the target to be imprisoned or to be forced into giving up land or a vassal (or possibly just killed in secret).
				Added *Replace Regent* plot, useable by the spouse, lover, close relative, councillor, or heir of the current liege. If successful, the current regent is replaced by the plotter.
				Added *Plot to Usurp* plot, useable by a regent on an incapable liege. If successful, the liege's titles will be usurped.
				Added *Take Revenge* plot, which is another version of the murder plots, but with different use conditions for the AI (more related to revenge or stopping a plot in progress).
				Added *Be Legitimized* ambition, useable by bastards (both acknowledged and denounced, but not hidden cuckoo bastards) and prompting an event chain where they approach their father and ask to be legitimized.
				The *Groom Your Heir* ambition has been completely altered - it is now useable if the ruler has an heir who is their child. Once that child is 12 years old, random events may fire which either grant the child a virtuous personality trait of the ruler's or remove a sinful trait which is opposite of a ruler's. Anytime between the ages of 12 and 20 the heir may be presented to the court via decision, and for a period of roughly six months (provided the ruler does not get into a war or the child become sick) random events will fire roughly every two weeks which can have random effects based on the child being present at court.
				The possible effects of the *Spy On* focus action have changed. It no longer allows possible kidnappings or assassinations. Possible effects are now: uncovering a plot by the target or a plotter they're supporting; speeding up the resolution of a plot currently in progress on the target; discovering a hidden bastard of the target and being able to either reveal the truth or blackmail the target; discovering that the target IS a hidden bastard and being able to either reveal the truth or blackmail the target's true father; discovering a lover of the target and being able to either reveal the truth or blackmail the target; discovering a chance to enflame a rivalry with the target's liege, a vassal of the target, or a fellow realm ruler of equal tier; or discovering a chance to slander the target and affect their reputation.
				Updated the *Seduce* focus action to have more restrictions and sensible targeting for the AI. Homosexuals are now allowed to target members of the same sex who aren't also homosexual, though the chances of success are far less. The chances of seduction success have been tweaked, with overall chance of success lowered.
		Dynasty Customization:
			Those who use the Ruler Designer may now select a trait called *Customize Ruler Dynasty*. Once the game begins, they will then have 15 days to select any living character of their culture group and use the *Set As Relative* diplo-decision (accessed by right-clicking on a character). This fires an event where they can set the character as a parent, sibling, niece/nephew, aunt/uncle (as appropriate). If they're not a bastard, they will assume that character's dynasty, and relatives will be assigned. You also have the option of just setting the target as 'a distant relative', in which case you will only assume their dynasty (this option is not available to bastards). Note that the system doesn't work perfectly when it comes to evaluating whether dead characters are old enough to be your parent, and you'll have to use your judgement.
		A version of the *Holy Roman Unification Claim* CB is now available to players using the TOG bookmark:
			While it was available to players once in a different form, the AI-only counterpart CB has been the only such CB in EMF for quite some time
			The CB's availability and behavior is similar to a de-jure-border-required weak claim on one of the Carolingien kingdoms; it does not, however, require an actual claim -- only that the Carolingien Empire is still a fresh memory, that the attacker holds one of the Carolingien kingdom titles (West Francia, Aquitaine, Burgundy, Italy, Bavaria, East Francia, and Lotharingia), and that the attacker can afford the CB's prestige cost of 1000
		Rollo's Invasion of Normandy:
			In the Old Gods bookmark, a duchy invasion may be launched by Rollo (named Hrolfr until his conversion) against the duchy of Normandy around 876 or later. Should Hrolfr win, he may eventually elect to convert to Christianity on his own, or may offer to kneel to an attacking Christian king (who is winning) and convert to his faith. In either case, converting means changing his name to Robert with 'Rollo' as a nickname, and assuming the Norman culture (as do his Frankish capital and any of his Norse courtiers). These events may also extend to his Norse heirs (though his heirs will not change name upon conversion, of course).
			The mechanic whereby a Rollo may bend the knee to an attacking Christian king and convert to their faith also applies to other Norse and Norman pagans with capitals in either Britain or France (the geographical region), and who are either *Cynical*, *Craven*, *Humble* or have *Sympathy Christendom*.
	*CHANGES:*
		The number of powerful vassals that expect a seat on the council has been reduced by 1 for each tier (now 3 for dukes, 4 for kings, and 5 for emperors).
		Factions:
			The AI for the claimant faction has been tweaked, so it now makes more sensible decisions regarding whom to support.
			NAPs (Non-Aggression Pacts) now block vassals from *joining* all standard, conspiratorial factions (i.e., all but the 4i -- 4-interest -- factions: *Court*, *Prosperity*, *Glory*, and *Tradition*).
		Casus Belli:
			The expiry of the *Holy Roman Unification Claim* CBs has been extended from 967 to as late as 1043 (2 centuries following the Treaty of Verdun) to promote more formation of the HRE from the TOG bookmark; additionally, successful usage of the CB by anyone will add another 50 years to the CB's expiry date (instead of previous 30 years).
			The AI will now have more opportunities to use their version of the *Holy Roman Unification Claim* CB.
			When vassals declare independence, their liege no longer gets claims on all of their titles but instead gains access to a new *Revassalize* CB for 40 years.
				The CB is lost when the former vassal dies, but it is inherited by the former liege's successor (expiry timer continues ticking as normal, however).
				If the former vassal becomes the same- or higher-tier than the former liege in the interim, they cannot be revassalized unless the former liege again attains a higher rank than the former vassal.
				The *Revassalize* CB only allows targeting former vassals who are currently nearby or upon the borders of the former liege's subrealm (unlike claim CBs).
		Added more sensible AI for when the *Ask Permission for Heritage Focus* decision will be taken and when permission will be granted by the child's liege (no longer auto-permitted).
		"Way of Life" focuses now each have one skill which they reduce by 1 in addition to their bonuses (a downside for focusing so heavily on one aspect of their life).
		Antipopes & Antikings:
			Independent rulers that find themselves in charge of an antipope of which they do not approve may now use the *Renounce Antipope* decision to end their realm's Anti-Papacy.
			The *Antiking* faction ultimatum acceptance and CB success code now forces non-feudal rulers to abdicate all their titles before they assume a feudal liege's primary title. One less source of King- and Emperor-Bishops!
		Bastards:
			Older AI rulers in realms with Gavelkind, Primogeniture, or Seniority succession without an heir whom is either their child or of their dynasty may now use the decision to legitimize acknowledged bastards.
			In realms with Gavelkind, Primogeniture, or Seniority succession, an inheriting ruler with an ambitious older bastard sibling may have that bastard become trouble and stake a claim against their inheritance.
			A hidden cuckoo bastard may begin to suspect their true parentage once they become an adult, and if their supposed father is either dead or hated they might approach their true father and demand the truth. The true father may admit it (making them an acknowledged bastard of their dynasty) or deny it. If they admit it, the bastard may ask to be legitimized.
		Claimant Adventurers:
			Must now achieve higher wealth goals in order to start adventures against kings and emperors (previously the wealth goal was target-tier-independent)
			Their recruited troops scale more proportionately to the target's strength (both in terms of the lower and higher end, so they will tend to be less overpowered against weak targets and will present a greater challenge to strong targets).
			AI decision-making regarding whether to support a claimant adventurer has been tweaked, so they're now:
				Less likely to support female claimants unless they are female themselves or part of a feminist religion
				Less likely to support claimants for titles to which they themselves have a claim
				Less likely to support claimants with weak claims
				More likely to support 'justified' claimants (e.g., one way for a claimant to be considered 'justified' is if they were once heir to their target title but disinherited by a succession law change)
		The North:
			(Vanilla Map) Added new Icelandic and Gothic (Geat) cultures.
			The Norman melting pot events have been updated, and may now appear before 950. They apply to any Frankish province with a Norse ruler (or vice-versa).
			Events which turn Norse provinces into Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Gothic (Geat), and Icelandic now occur a bit more rapidly, may spread outside of their home geographical region (if their de jure kingdom has expanded), and will not occur at all in a Norse empire (meaning a Norse emperor will maintain the Norse culture of his entire realm).
		Military:
			The commander limit has been raised by 1 for dukes (now 5) and 2 for kings and emperors (now 8 and 10, respectively); remember, the ruler themselves and their marshal (if not assigned a job) can always serve as flank commanders as well.
			Levy reinforcement rate has been reduced to 3%/month (from 4%/month), and retinue reinforce rate has been reduced to vanilla (now 2.5%/month instead of 3%/month).
			Levy maintenance cost has been increased by +10%, while the liege levy maintenance cost factor (upkeep cost paid by vassals for their raised liege levy contribution) has been increased +20% (still a huge discount relative to their liege's upkeep cost for demesne levies -- remember, demesne levies can be raised at 100% morale while liege levies cannot).
			AI will now be significantly less aggressive about declarations of war -- general willingness to declare war given a valid CB has been reduced to vanilla's current level (which is significantly higher in CK2 v2.5 vs. past versions).
		Coronation:
			Mechanic no longer applies to king-tier viceroys (*Imperial* or *al-Mulk* government).
			Rulers no longer receive individual replies when sending out invitations to coronations; those duke- and above-tier who are attending and those who are not will instead be summarized in the tooltip on the event which initiates the coronation feast.
		Succession Laws:
			When a succession law change displaces an expected heir from their place in the line of succession, the former heir will now get a weak claim (and "justified claimant" status) even if they choose to graciously accept the law change at the time. Previously, such displaced heirs only gained a claim if they chose to respond to the succession law change in outrage (a strong claim), a choice weighted by their traits; this behavior remains -- the difference due to their chosen reaction is now weak vs. strong claim strength (and degree of opinion malus).
			When players take the decision to *Form the Holy Roman Empire* or *Form the Saint-Empire Romain*, the empire's succession law will no longer automatically change to Feudal Elective but use the succession law of the [previous] primary title of the founder, as with any empire formation.
			*Tradition* faction wars demanding that the liege revert to a prior succession law, upon success, no longer punish the liege with succession law change opinion maluses (and awarded claims) for a law that liege did not actually change. However, accepting the faction's ultimatum peacefully to revert the succession law will still behave as if the liege changed the law.
		The event chain involving a non-aggression pact created by a wife's visit now only involves nearby realms and has some more sensible conditions applied to it.
		Some of the random regency events have been restricted to depend more on the regent being greedy or having other negative traits. In particular, the "regent steals a holding" event now also only occurs when the liege has over five holdings or is over their max demesne count, and the "regent lowers crown authority" event can only occur once per ruler.
		Failure to seduce will now result in the seducer being unable to seduce that target for five years (instead of 20), and the target will be unable to be seduced by anyone for a single year (instead of 10).
		Duchy adventurers will no longer destroy merchant republics with their adventures.
		All empire and kingdom titles now have a standardized and centralized set of conditions for creation/usurpation.
	*MINOR CHANGES:*
		For empires affected by the *Imperial Decay* mechanic, the decision to *Lower Imperial Decay* is now always shown even if the decay value is below 10, so you may always access your exact *Imperial Decay* rating at any time.
		The *Ask Permission for Heritage Focus* diplo-decision is now not available for use by the child's parent and proper liege (you don't need to ask yourself for permission)
		The Heritage childhood focus is now only available if the child's educator/guardian has a different culture or religion than the child (otherwise, it's pointless)
		The *Court Anarchy* trait (used for the Anarchy at Samarra event chain) no longer reduces the Caliph's health and has a less severe opinion malus (but is still incapacitating)
	*FIXES:*
		Attending another ruler's coronation will no longer prevent access to feasts, hunts, etc.
		An Orthodox Roman Empire can now properly use the Byzantine coronation system.
		The *Uncrowned* trait is now gained one day after assuming the title (as opposed to immediately) to avoid certain conditions which could lead to an invalid ruler gaining it.
		The *Become Muslim Poet* decision now properly disappears after taking it.
		Fixed an issue with the *Press All Claims* CB which bypassed the all-CBs block upon non-republican AIs wiping-out AI merchant republics (thanks to @2ndPorphyry for helping us catch this loophole)
		Child prisoners, whose educator defaults to their captor while imprisoned, no longer advance their personal combat or diplomatic training while imprisoned.
		The 4-interest faction opinion modifier "Faction Disapproves of Obligations" now correctly gives negative opinion instead of positive.
		Vanilla friendship events where you're given the option to join a friend's war have had that option removed in favor of simply offering or requesting financial support for the war (friends cannot necessarily always join each others' wars -- pretty rare when they can, in fact, so this was incoherent most of the time).
		Tweaked vanilla HL "mercenary captain elopes with your daughter" event to be a bit less confusing and more sensible.
		Fixed vanilla feast-end event's errant custom tooltip reference, and the event now again shows all the opinion effects of the feast.
		Paulician rulers should now properly be able to use all religious / holy war CBs against any ruler not of their religion.

	*MAJOR*
		Imperial Decay:
			All emperors who are non-tribal and non-nomadic must now contend with a rating called *Imperial Decay*. This increases with each succession based on several factors: +1-4 based on whether this is an ongoing dynasty (the longer the same dynasty rules the land, the more ID goes up each succession), +2 if the title was usurped, +1 if the Imperial Administration law exists, +3 if Crown Authority is Limited or Autonomous Vassals, +2 if Crown Authority is Medium, +1 if Crown Authority is High, and -2 to +7 based on the empires gross size. An overthrow actually reduces ID by 10 ('out with the old, in with the new'). From that point, ID is increased further by losing major wars but can be reduced by winning major wars, holding tournaments, becoming coronated, and also through the *Lower Imperial Decay* decision.
			A number of random events may fire which raise or lower *Imperial Decay* based on the positive or negative qualities of the emperor (or their regent).
			The ruler's exact *Imperial Decay* value will be displayed in the notification box each time it changes. It is also visible in the description of the *Lower Imperial Decay* decision, if 10+.
			What does *Imperial Decay* actually do? If it's less than 10, nothing. Once it raises above 10 it will start reducing the taxes received, the Morale of raised troops, the amount of levies acquired from castle holdings in the emperor's personal domain, and the required levy percentage of vassals. The malus increases every 10 points of ID until it reaches 81+.
		Coronations:
			All feudal, non-nomadic, non-horde rulers of king or emperor tier now gain the *Uncrowned* trait upon gaining their title. While this trait exists, Crown Authority cannot be increased and weak claims can be pressed even by those who would otherwise be unable to. The trait lasts until an official coronation is held - this is done by decision, requiring the ruler be at peace, have at least 25 Piety, and a full year's income on hand for the expensive event. This will start an event chain for the coronation itself as well as the feast following, at the end of which the *Crowned* trait will be applied.
			A Catholic head of the HRE (or Roman Empire) must first request permission from the Pope before they can hold a coronation. If the Pope grants permission, they will perform the coronation ceremony themselves, and the ruler will receive a *Crowned by the Pope* trait instead of simply a *Crowned* trait.
			Orthodox rulers of the ERE (or Roman Empire) have a different system - they must first request permission from the Ecumenical Patriarch to hold their coronation, much like with the HRE. The trait which is applied as a result, however, is either *Coronated Basileus* or *Strong Basileus*...which it is depends on a number of factors regarding the new ruler's lineage and stats. A ruler who gains *Coronated Basileus* may upgrade to *Strong Basileus* through the use of the *Prove Your Rule* decision (requiring an expenditure of Prestige and Piety). An Ecumenical Patriarch who refuses to coronate the emperor may be deposed and replaced, though at the cost of tyranny. Note that this also applies to rulers of the ERE who are Iconclast, Bogomilist, or Monothelite -- provided they have a religion head who is also their vassal. If not, then regular coronation rules apply.
	*CHANGES:*
		Characters with the Byzantine/Roman *Despot* minor title are now an additional councilmember, similar to the *Adviser* title
		The Messalian *Join the Cult of Lucifer* decision is no longer exclusive to becoming a Messalian Master
		The *Religious Emancipation* decision may now only be taken by independent rulers
		Made the *Become Muslim Mystic* and *Become Muslim Poet* decisions more visible, so their requirements can be seen by the player
		New trait icons for *Cult of Lucifer* and *Perfection* (Messalian)
		Monks, nuns, and their Coptic equivalents now set aside their vows if they gain a landed title due to, e.g., a successful claimant faction demand to install them
		Allowing a viceroy to keep their title by having them bribe the emperor or give the emperor a favor now increases *Imperial Decay* rather than affecting vassal opinions.
		Added the *Corrupt Councillor* diplo-decision, which allows a ruler with Imperial Government (or al-Mulk Government) to apply a +50 opinion bonus to a member of their council by simultaneously increasing their *Imperial Decay* rating - provided the councillor is susceptible to corruption and the ruler has not done so recently.
		*Imperial Reconquest* CB now requires the *Strong Basileus* trait to use -- if you do not obtain it upon coronation, you'll need to use the *Prove Your Rule* decision to get it -- unless your religion is neither Orthodox, Iconoclast, Bogomilist, nor Monothelite, in which case you need 500 prestige
	*FIXES:*
		Rebel reinforcement events should no longer fire for more than one type of rebel at the same time
		When rebels take a county, the effects of more than one type of rebel conquest should now not apply at the same time
		Fixed an issue with the *Imperial Reconquest* CB wherein a successful war would sometimes cause vassals of the target duchy title to go independent under some circumstances
		*Become Muslim Mystic* decision now applies the trait properly
		*Raise Zealots* decision, available to Kharijites and Paulicians, now allowed for tribal rulers
		Description for Manichaean religion updated
		The Abbasid emperor now properly begins the Old Gods bookmark with the *Court Anarchy* trait already applied
		Fixed errent definition for one of the Bogomilist holy sites
		We should now be seeing less adventurers who become republics or theocracies upon winning their target title
		Women should now only become crusade adventurers if they are eligible to become marshals/army leaders in their home court


EMF 5.05 [2016-05-24]
	*MAJOR:*
		Religion/Heresy Update:
			Many of the game's heresies (and a few of the non-heresies) have been given an upgrade to ensure their differences are more than simply cosmetic. The individual alterations are noted under the Changes section below, but the major features are listed here.
			There is a new system called *Lateral Conversion* which applies whenever a character or province would normally convert to a random heresy. Weighting to particular heresies is given based on the character or province's culture and/or location, but it is also possible for them to convert to heresies of other religions within their group, other non-heretical religions within their group, or (at a much smaller chance) even other religion groups altogether if the conditions are right (meaning if they are in the right regions for such conversion to be realistic -- you're not going to have German Catholics converting to Muslim in Frisia, for instance).
			*Adoptionist* and *Arian* have been added as early Catholic heresies. They exist in the Charlemagne and Old Gods bookmarks, and will stop appearing after 1000 provided there are no rulers with those heresies currently in existence.
			*Miaphysite* has been broken up into *Coptic* and *Apostolic*. Apostolic covers Armenia and Georgia, led by the Catholicos religion head, while Coptic is everything else (in Egypt, Nubia, and Ethiopia) and still led by the Coptic Pope religion head. *Paulician* has been moved to be a heresy of Apostolic rather than Orthodox, and *Tondrakian* has been added as an additional Apostolic heresy.
			*Maronite* has been added as a non-heretical Christian religion, covering the few provinces around Beirut which are currently marked as Monothelite.
			*Mahdite* and *Nabawite* have been added as new Sunni heresies (as per Gwyn ap Nud's *Religion Improvement Project*).
			*Yazidi* has been moved into the Zoroastrian religion group, and is no longer considered a heresy (but is still valid for Muslim lateral conversion).
			*Haruri* has been added as a new Ibadi heresy (as per RIP).
			*Isma'ili* has been broken off from *Shiite* as a new non-heretical Muslim faith (which is initially a heresy until the rebellion event around 900). *Waqifi* and *Zaydi* have been added as Shiite heresies (as per RIP), while *Druze* and *Qarmatian* are Isma'ili heresies (also as per RIP).
			*Zurvanist* has been added as a new Zoroastrian heresy.
			*Manichean* is no longer a Zoroastrian heresy, but a non-heretical religion within the Zoroastrian group. *Mandaean* has been added as a heresy for it.
		Adventurer Update:
			Claimant adventurers must now raise sufficient coin for their cause in order to actually begin their war. They will assume a temporary title immediately and begin touring realms outside their target's in search of rulers whom will either grant them coin or let them canvass their demesne and vassals for support. Those rulers also have the option of sending them away or even attempting to capture the adventurer in order to ransom them back to the adventurer's target. Once the adventurer gets enough coin, they will raise their army and attack -- marching from the capital of a ruler who offered them assistance. If they don't raise enough support, are imprisoned due to betrayal, end up with a landed title, or die (nevermind how!), then their adventure will be abandoned.
			Women may now also become claimant adventurers if the target title does not have Agnatic succession and the claimant is both Ambitious and is formidable (has very high stats). If the title is Absolute Cognatic, the female claimant need only be Ambitious to qualify.
			Duchy adventurers (such as vikings in search of their own duchies) have had their targeting AI upgraded, and will tend to target smaller realms of a different culture group before they target larger ones. Seafaring adventurers will also focus on targets which are in the same 'sea zone' (example: Norwary, Denmark, Britain and the northern coast of France and Germany are all part of the same *North Sea zone*) rather than ranging further.
			The first 100 years of the Viking Age will now see Norse duchy adventurers being far more commonplace than they otherwise would be with their more focused targeting.
		Decadence Replacement:
			Muslim males will now, once again, acquire the Decadent trait.
			Instead of 'decadence' being tracked as a rating, the head of a Muslim dynasty can acquire a *Decadent Dynasty* trait of increasing negative effect based on the number of dynasty members who are Decadent. The dynasty head themselves being Decadent is even more serious. The only Decadent dynasty members which apply to this total, however, are those who are vassals or below of the dynasty head. If they're in other realms, then they will not contribute toward a *Decadent Dynasty* rating.
			An independent Muslim ruler with the *Decadent Dynasty* trait at a higher level of negative effect may get events that increase the chance of rebellion in provinces of their religion, and a rebellion that begins in that province may be a *Decadence Rebellion* which will seek independence.
			The *Convince to Straighten Up* diplo-decision can only be taken by the dynasty head against Decadent members of their dynasty who are their vassals or below. It requires 50 Piety to use the decision on a non-ruler and 100 Piety to use it on a ruler. If the target ultimately refuses to abandon their Decadent trait, they may be arrested and justifiably banished (but not executed). The AI logic involved for both the dynasty head and the target has been improved.
			An imprisoned Muslim dynasty member who has the *Takfir* opinion modifier may be banished by their dynasty head even if the dynasty head is not their proper liege.
			Decadent characters who are exiled or who escape imprisonment will gain a non-inheritable claim on close family members' titles, and will be much more likely to become adventurers.
			If the Muslim dynasty head is not the liege or above of a same-dynasty ruler, that ruler may elect to begin their own dynasty. They may do this after one year of rule, but the AI will not do so if they are the heir or a pretender to any titles held by a member of their dynasty.
	*CHANGES:*
		Crusade changes:
			There is no longer a customization decision for Vanilla Crusades.
			A religion head must possess a non-titular title in order to declare a crusade.
			Previously, there was a delay of several years after the vanilla event which declared the commencement of the Christian crusades or the Muslim jihads and the actual flag being set which permitted the CB to actually be used. This delay also occurred after the beginning of a game after 1095 (to prevent instantaneous dueling crusades/jihads from being declared by the AI). The player had no idea, however, of when the CB was actually unlocked. The events have now been changed to make it so that only the *last* one, the one which actually prompts the CB to be useable, shows the event that all players see.
			After a victorious crusade where the crusade kingdom has been handed to a third party (which the AI will do automatically, unless the conquered lands immediately neighbor their own), participants who did not win the kingdom will be contacted by the religion head and asked if they wish to send a relative or worthy courtier to the new kingdom, possibly assuming a county in the kingdom if one is available.
			A particularly ambitious or zealous courtier may decide to join the crusades as an adventurer. If the crusade is successful, they will very likely assume a county within the conquered kingdom. If the crusade fails, they will either return to their home court or take their forces and become a mercenary.
		General religion changes:
			Religion heads (other than Catholic, Fraticelli, or Orthodox) which have no title other than their titular religion head title may be vassalized by a ruler of their faith who has at least 500 Piety and has a holy site within their realm to grant them.
			Christian monks/nuns will now be called 'Brother' and 'Sister'. More courtiers will become monks and nuns on their own (though members of a player's dynasty in their own court will always ask).
		Cathar changes:
			Receive -25% fertility for all Cathar characters.
			Have new holy site locations.
			Cathar children have an increased chance of becoming Chaste or Homosexual, while zealous adults have a chance of becoming Celibate.
			May not use the Seduction, Hunting, or Family focus.
			Receive -20% garrison size and -20% levy size, but +30% morale.
			May not become monks/nuns - they have access to a *Consolomentum* decision which grants them the *Perfecti* trait (and makes them Celibate).
			A Cathar ruler without an heir who is either old or celibate may use an *Adopt an Heir* decision to search for a young boy in a Cathar realm province to adopt as their son (they gain an *Adopted* trait).
			Cathars may not use the Religious or Crusade CB until they are unlocked by event, requiring a Catholic ruler to have first used one of the CB's against any Cathar ruler.
			Are less frequent until the *Council of Saint Felix* event fires in the 12th century.
			May now acquire a Cathar Patriarch/Matriarch as a religion head via decision. This religion head is elected by a Council of Perfecti, much like the Catholic cardinals.
			May declare themselves a non-heresy via decision: this requires a religion head and an exceptionally pious and prestigious ruler, and may result in the former parent religion's religion head declaring a crusade against them. If the crusade succeeds, the religion remains a heresy forever (unless it should gain prominence over the parent, as usual). If the crusade fails, the heresy gains its own icon and becomes a non-heresy within the parent's religion group.
		Fraticelli changes:
			Receive +2 Learning, but -1 Stewardship and -50% tax from all temple holdings.
			Have access to a special *Fraticelli Priesthood* law, determining how the faith is organized within the realm.
			Are less frequent until the *Brother Angelo* event fires in the early 13th century.
		Waldensian changes:
			Receive +2 Stewardship but -50% tax from all temple holdings.
			Receive +50% garrison size when defending in their home territory.
			Have new holy site locations.
			Waldensian priests may both inherit and marry.
			Have access to a special *Waldensian Charity* law and special *Give to the Poor* and *Build Hospital* decisions.
			Have access to a *Translate the Bible* decision, which will begin an event chain.
			Upon adulthood, a heretic Waldensian may choose one of three special traits as their path.
			Have a small number of unique events for rulers based on greed and charity.
			Are less frequent until the *Poor of Lyons* event fires in the early 12th century.
			A Waldensian ruler may become the religion head through decision, and it's playable (and does not become a Theocracy). The religion head may not excommunicate or grant claims.
			May declare themselves a non-heresy via decision: this requires a religion head and an exceptionally pious and prestigious ruler, and may result in the former parent religion's religion head declaring a crusade against them. If the crusade succeeds, the religion remains a heresy forever (unless it should gain prominence over the parent, as usual). If the crusade fails, the heresy gains its own icon and becomes a non-heresy within the parent's religion group.
		Lollard changes:
			Receive -50% tax from all temple holdings.
			Have new holy site locations.
			Lollard priests may marry.
			Lollard monks, nuns, and those with the Celibate trait may use a *Renounce Vows* decision if they have enough Piety.
			May acquire a Lollard Primate as a religion head via decision.
			Have access to a *Translate the Bible* decision, which will begin an event chain.
			Lollard rulers may acquire a claim against any titles above Count tier held by theocracies in their realm, without penalty.
			Lollard rulers may revoke titles held by theocracies who are either not Lollard or who have the *Wicked Priest* trait, without penalty.
			Are less frequent until the *John Wycliff* event fires in the early 14th century.
			May declare themselves a non-heresy via decision: this requires a religion head and an exceptionally pious and prestigious ruler, and may result in the former parent religion's religion head declaring a crusade against them. If the crusade succeeds, the religion remains a heresy forever (unless it should gain prominence over the parent, as usual). If the crusade fails, the heresy gains its own icon and becomes a non-heresy within the parent's religion group.
		Adoptionist heresy added:
			Adoptionists are functionally the same as Catholics in all gameplay aspects. They do not have a religion head.
		Arian heresy added:
			Arians are functionally the same as Catholics in all gameplay aspects. They do not have a religion head.
		Bogomilist changes:
			Have new holy site locations.
			Does not use autocephaly or use the pentarchy, unlike Orthodox.
			Bogomilist priests can marry, once they begin to appear.
			May not become monks/nuns - they have access to a *Consolomentum* decision which grants them the *Perfecti* trait (and makes them Celibate).
			A Bogomilist ruler without an heir who is either old or celibate may use an *Adopt an Heir* decision to search for a young boy in a Bogomilist realm province to adopt as their son (they gain an *Adopted* trait).
			Have access to a *Build Church of St. Bogomil* decision.
			An event for Bogomil's appearance in early bookmarks has been added -- prior to this event, the appearance of Bogomilists will be much rarer.
			Bogomilists start off with their own feudal government type -- functionally it is the same as regular Feudal Government, but it allows rulers to control temple holdings as well.
			Bogomilism starts off as a very decentralized religion that is anti-authoritarian and difficult for Bogomilist rulers to control. They do not have a priesthood (meaning there are no Bogomilist Bishops), and Bogomilist Perfecti will start off not being eligible for most council positions. They can, however, slowly formalize the faith through a series of decisions and a *Faith Organization* law. It will take many years to complete, and may involve upheaval during the process, but if it should be achieved then a religion head title can be created (elected by a Council of Advisors, similar to the Catholic cardinals) -- allowing Bogomilist bishops to appear and making Bogomilism no longer an Orthodox heresy but a non-heretical religion within the Christian group.
		Monothelite changes:
			If they have 12+ Learning, they may use the *Embrace Alexandrine School* decision.
		Iconoclast changes:
			New *Acheiropoieta* event chain.
			An Orthodox Byzantine ruler before 1000 who is badly losing in a religious war may fire the *Constantine's Return* event, which may prompt them to become Iconoclast or suffer the consequences.
		Apostolic religion added:
			All Miaphysites in the Armenia/Georgia region in eastern Anatolia are now Apostolic.
			They are functionally the same as Miaphysites in most gameplay aspects, save for having their own holy sites and their own religion head, who always exists.
			If they have 12+ Learning, they may use the *Embrace Alexandrine School* decision.
			May create the Order of Saint Blaise holy order.
		Paulician changes:
			Now exists as an Apostolic heresy, though Orthodox characters may laterally convert to it.
			Receives +50% morale and +50% light infantry offensive modifiers.
			Have new holy site locations.
			May always loot, regardless of cultural or government restrictions.
			Paulician priests may both marry and inherit.
			If they have 12+ Learning, they may use the *Embrace Alexandrine School* decision.
			May create the Order of Saint Blaise holy order.
			May expend 250 Piety to raise a unit of zealots in the same manner that tribal rulers expend prestige.
			The Byzantine ruler has access to a *Suppress Paulicians* decision in early bookmarks, which will attempt to convert Paulician provinces and 'moves' many to a province in present-day Bulgaria.
			Paulicians may holy war and use the crusade CB against all who are not their religion, not just those outside their religion group.
			The Paulician Patriarch is a playable religion head which remains Feudal Government and does not turn into a Theocracy. The religion head may not excommunicate or grant divorces. Added a decision to become the Paulician Patriarch, if one does not already exist. The Paulician Patriarch may be vassalized by a more powerful Paulician ruler even if they are landed.
			May declare themselves a non-heresy via decision: this requires a religion head and an exceptionally pious and prestigious ruler, and may result in the former parent religion's religion head declaring a crusade against them. If the crusade succeeds, the religion remains a heresy forever (unless it should gain prominence over the parent, as usual). If the crusade fails, the heresy gains its own icon and becomes a non-heresy within the parent's religion group.
		Tondrakian heresy added:
			They do not have a religion head title.
			Does not use autocephaly or use the pentarchy, unlike Apostolic.
			Is feminist and allows for female temple holders.
			Allows Tondrakian rulers to gain up to three consorts in addition to their wife.
			If they have 12+ Learning, they may use the *Embrace Alexandrine School* decision.
			May create the Order of Saint Blaise holy order.
		Maronite religion added:
			Maronites are functionally the same as Orthodox in all gameplay aspects. They have access to their own religion head, who always exists.
			If they have 12+ Learning, they may use either the *Embrace Alexandrine School* or *Embrace Antiochian School* decision.
		Miaphysite changes:
			Now called *Coptic* in-game.
			May now create the Knights of Saint Mark holy order.
			If they have 12+ Learning, they may use the *Embrace Alexandrine School* decision.
			Have access to a *Become Desert Father* or *Become Desert Mother* decision, which grants them a trait similar to monk/nun. Desert fathers and mothers are wandering ascetics (given a 'Father' or 'Mother' title) -- they will abdicate whatever landed titles they possess and occasionally wander from court to court to proselytize.
		Nestorian changes:
			If they have 12+ Learning, they may use the *Embrace Antiochian School* decision.
		Messalian changes:
			Receives +2 Intrigue but -2 Diplomacy.
			Messlian priests may marry.
			Lunatic, Possessed, or Depressed Messalian men may castrate themselves for a Piety bonus.
			Messalians may attempt to 'expel their daemons' through a decision and an event chain, whereby they begin praying and try to remove many of their negative traits. Doing so comes at a cost, but if it is eventually successful they gain the *Perfection* trait, whereby they are now considered free to sin. Those who do not try to achieve Perfection may instead opt to join the *Cult of Lucifer* through decision.
			Upon adulthood, may choose a patron saint.
			The Euchite Patriarchy religion head title may be created via decision, requiring that Antioch is held.
			If they have 12+ Learning, they may use the *Embrace Antiochian School* decision.
			May create the Army of Lucifer holy order.
			May declare themselves a non-heresy via decision: this requires a religion head and an exceptionally pious and prestigious ruler, and may result in the former parent religion's religion head declaring a crusade against them. If the crusade succeeds, the religion remains a heresy forever (unless it should gain prominence over the parent, as usual). If the crusade fails, the heresy gains its own icon and becomes a non-heresy within the parent's religion group.
		General Muslim changes:
			Added the regnal naming system for the Sunni caliph, as per the RIP sub-mod.
			The Abbasids have a new *Anarchy at Samarra* event chain (in the Old Gods bookmark, it is already underway). When activated, it adds a *Court Anarchy* trait to the Caliph, incapacitating them (they have been essentially imprisoned by their own council) and throwing the caliphate into general chaos. This will persist until the caliph or a successor has sufficient stats to re-assert order and declare the existing council to be traitors.
			Most Muslim faiths now have access to a *Become Muslim Poet* and a *Become Muslim Mystic* decision at age 20, costing 100 Piety to give them the lifestyle trait. Muslims with the Poet trait can use a *Write An Epic Poem* decision to begin an event chain -- which could result in catastrophic failure or the acquisition of the *Diwan Poet* trait. Muslims with the Mystic, Theologian, or Scholar trait can use *Study the Mysteries of the Qur'an* to begin a chain where they immerse themselves in study for various benefits (and possible negative side-effects) -- including access to several levels of the *Sufi* trait. Those with the *Sufi Master* and Mystic trait have additional access to a special *Search for Omens* decision.
		Mahdite heresy added:
			Mahdites are functionally the same as Sunni in all gameplay aspects. They have access to their own caliphate religion head title.
		Nabawaite heresy added:
			Nabawites are functionally the same as Sunni in all gameplay aspects. They have unique holy site locations, and have access to their own caliphate religion head title.
		Kharijite changes:
			Receives +2 Martial but -2 Diplomacy.
			Receives 80% morale bonus and 80% offensive modifier to light infantry.
			May expend 250 Piety to raise a unit of zealots in the same manner that tribal rulers expend prestige.
			Kharijites may declare jihad against all who are not their religion, not just those outside their religion group.
			Have access to a *Public Execution* diplo-action, which grants piety and prestige based on the rank and relative importance of whoever's being executed -- including relatives.
			Kharijites may accuse a target as *Kafir* -- including their own liege -- if they are decadent or an otherwise less-than-stellar example of Muslim piety. Kafir have heavy negatives, but may use decisions to attempt to rid themselves of negative traits and eventually lose their apostate status.
		Haruri heresy added:
			Haruri are functionally the same as Ibadi in all gameplay aspects. They do not have a religion head title.
		Shiite changes:
			Shiite has been split into two faiths, with *Isma'ili* added as a separate non-heretical religion within the Muslim group with its own caliph title as religion head. It begins as a Shiite heresy, however, until the *Isma'ili Caliphate Rising* event chain (which replaces the Shi'a Caliphate Rising, and has been changed to make it both more likely to happen and more powerful) around 900. At that point, Isma'ili becomes its own faith with its own heresies.
			One who inherits or usurps the Shiite or Ismaili caliphate title must either be a close relative of the previous holder or pay 250 Piety (and be Sayyid). If not, the title is destroyed.
		Waqifi heresy added:
			Waqifi are functionally the same as Shiite in all gameplay aspects. They do not have a religion head title.
		Zaydi heresy added:
			Zaydi are functionally the same as Shiite in all gameplay aspects. They have access to their own caliphate religion head title.
			One who inherits or usurps the Zaydi caliphate title must either be a close relative of the previous holder or pay 250 Piety (and be Sayyid). If not, the title is destroyed.
		Druze changes:
			Is no longer a heresy but a separate faith within the Muslim group.
			Does not appear at all until the *Isma'ili Caliphate Rising* event chain (or after 909).
			Receives +2 Intrigue.
			Receives +20% morale bonus.
			May only have 1 wife, as opposed to the normal 4 in other Muslim religions.
			Does not permit jizya tax, unlike other Muslim religions.
			Is feminist and allows for female temple holders. Matrilineal marriages are always allowed.
			Uses the Indian reincarnation system.
			Have access to a Prepared Invasion CB, useable by particularly pious or capable Druze against other Muslims. It works the same as the viking CB, but without the event forces and delay.
			Use the *Pact of Time* decision to become Juhhal, and may afterwards use the *Study the Esoteric Secrets* to raise their rank to Uqqal. A sufficiently worthy Uqqal may afterwards become Ajawid.
			They now have access to their own caliphate religion head title, available to an Ajawid of sufficient Piety and power.
		Qarmatian heresy added:
			They do not have a religion head title.
			Does not appear until the *Isma'ili Caliphate Rising* event chain, and at that point is treated as an Isma'ili heresy, although it can be laterally converted to by many Muslims.
			Receives 80% bonus to morale and 80% offensive modifier to light infantry/heavy infantry/light cavalry.
			May always loot, regardless of cultural or government restrictions.
		Mazdaki changes:
			Receives +30% morale and +30% defensive bonus when fighting in their home territory.
			Mazdaki rulers receive -25% tax from all holdings.
			Is feminist and allows for female temple holders.
			Does NOT allow for divine blood and close-relative marriages, unlike its Zoroastrian parent.
			Have access to a *Wealth Sharing* law, which determines how much Mazdaki vassals are required to share their wealth with the poor.
			May create a new religion head title via decision.
			On adulthood, may choose a Power to serve via decision.
			Added a *Khorramdin Rebellion* event chain for the early bookmarks, affecting the Abbasids.
		Zurvanist heresy added:
			Zurvanists are functionally the same as Zoroastrian in all gameplay aspects. They do not have a religion head title.
		Manichean changes:
			Manichean is now its own non-heretical faith within the Zoroastrian group.
			Receives +30% morale and +30% defensive bonus when fighting in their home territory.
			Have new holy site locations.
			Do not use the normal feasts, instead having access to *Oberve Bema Feast* decision.
			Upon adulthood, may choose a Shekinah via decision.
			Have access to a special *Patronize Art* decision.
			May form the Army of Light holy order.
			Uses the Indian reincarnation system.
			May create a religion head via decision, elected by a Council of Apostles (in the same manner as Catholic cardinals). The Manichean Archegos may be vassalized by a more powerful Manichean ruler even if they are landed.
		Mandaean heresy added:
			Mandaeans are functionally the same as Manichean in all gameplay aspects. They do not have a religion head title.
		Yazidi changes:
			Yazidi is now its own non-heretical faith within the Zoroastrian group, though may be laterally converted to by many Muslims.
			It still permits 4 wives and rulers lose piety for attacking members of the same faith, like Muslims, but does not use jizya tax.
			Do not use the normal feasts, instead having access to *Celebrate Tawûsgeran* decision.
			May go on a special Yazidi pilgrimage to Lalish, similar to Christian pilgrimages or the Muslim hajj.
			Uses the Indian reincarnation system.
			An exceptional Yazidi young man has a chance at being recognized as a *Koasasa*, a reincarnation of one of the Yazidi angels. Only one of each can exist at a time, and the trait they confer has considerable benefits.
			Their religion head is no longer a caliphate title.
		Catalan culture now has a unique castle cultural building reflecting its Almoghavar retinue
		AI Christian nobles will now be much more likely to take duel-defeated foes on the battlefield prisoner than kill them
		*Free Investiture* is now always default before 1000AD, and *Papal Investiture* the default afterward
		AI will now seek to institute *Imperial Administration* (and thus switch to imperial government type) when it meets the requirements
		Loyalist and Malcontent law voting patterns added for the *Centralization* and *Status of Women* law groups
		Minimum realm size required to create a custom kingdom again reduced to 35 holdings
		Battlefield duel probability reduced by a further -30%
		Baseline fertility has been increased (esp. during ages 20-29 or for lovers/concubines), and the *Lustful* and *Fertile* traits are now more effective
	*FIXES:*
		Castillan, Aragonese, and Leonese retinues can now be hired properly
		The *Imperial Reconquest Tier* decisions no longer display "ANY_ALL" for uncontrolled province names in their effect tooltip; one can now see those provinces' names without having to actually take the decision
		Fixed a loophole w/ the all-CBs block upon non-republican AIs wiping out AI merchant republics which was possible with so-called "de jure territory" CBs such as invasions, holy wars, imperial reconquest, etc. (versus those that directly contest held titles)
		Fixed an issue where the *Subjugation* CB could be used to "steal" vassals out from under lieges with more immediate de jure pretension
		When new primary titles of Duke+ tier are granted to *Feudal* or *Iqta* vassals by *Imperial* or *al-Mulk* lieges, they will now properly switch government types.
		[SWMH] Mongol AI will no longer stall and do nothing in historical starts where they're already on the map
	*MINOR FIXES:*
		*Imperial Reconquest* CB now usurps the target duchy title under more correct circumstances
		No longer allowed to serve a claimant faction ultimatum for a supported claimant that's already in open revolt


EMF 5.04 [2016-04-30]
	*FIXES:*
		Any issues with imperial governments flipping to, er, nomadic governments should be resolved (was an issue whenever using the Ruler Designer to replace a historical Byzantine Emperor but the bug could be triggered in other ways too)
		Imperial lieges subjugating Muslims will not cause the Muslims' government form to switch to nomadic (will instead switch to Imperial); the opposite problem for *al-Mulk* lieges subjugating non-Muslims has also been resolved


EMF 5.03 [2016-04-29]
	*MAJOR:*
		No Ahistorical Empires (new default de jure setup):
			By default, EMF now starts with only historically de jure empires on the map (Holy Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, and Persian Empire)
			New scenario customization decision: *Add Ahistorical Empires*
				Enables the map's usual ahistorical de jure empires. This customization is reversible with the classic *Remove Ahistorical Empires* scenario customization decision, which appears after enacting the former decision (and vice versa).
				NOTE: The custom kingdom/empire formation decisions are always available to players regardless of the choice to add/remove ahistorical de jure empire, and such custom kingdoms/empires are always disabled for the AI regardless of this setting as well.
			With the default setup, the map's usual ahistorical de jure empires are only rendered titular and NOT deactivated
				Player & AI multi-kings alike can still create the *titular* empires if they control the empire title's de jure capital and meet the minimum requirements for empire title creation (e.g., total realm size) in addition to any other title-specific requirements (usually related to control of specific titles and culture/religion)
				If you want to fully deactivate them, first use the new customization decision *Add Ahistorical Empires* followed by the traditional *Remove Ahistorical Empires* to make it final
		*Feudal Elective Succession* UNLOCKED: it's now always an alternative, additional succession law option for *player* Muslims and Indians
		Decadence Removal:
			Decadence has been removed from the game. It is a flawed concept which requires a complete overhaul before it will return.
				The notion that all Muslims of common patrilineal descent suffer a curse/blessing for the "sins" of their dynasty members, no matter how distant or unrelated-- and that these dynasty-wide effects include armies' morale, vassal limit, demesne income, chance of random invasion from implausible sources, etc. -- is all stunningly fictional.
				NOTE: It is probable that EMF will adopt some form of Rylock's work on decadence replacement in CK2Plus in the future. In short, his approach also completely removes the hard-coded decadence mechanic, but it replaces it with a soft-coded mechanic which is limited to dynasty members in the same top realm, among other improvements.
			Iqta & Tribal government types no longer use decadence at all
			Decadence events/decisions/ambitions/invasions/defines have been disabled (i.e., the things which serve no other purpose but to affect/reflect decadence)
		Viceroyalty Update (brought over from CK2Plus and implemented by @Rylock):
			Due to myriad bugs and gameplay-suboptimal restrictions with the Charlemagne DLC's implementation of viceroyalties, how they work has been radically changed compared to vanilla CK2:
				There is no separate law for establishing viceroyalties - it comes into play only once the *Imperial Administration* law has been implemented.
				Under the *Imperial Administration* law, the government type will change to *Imperial* (or *al-Mulk* for Muslims - all references to *Imperial* government from this point will apply equally to the *al-Mulk* variant). This government type allows free revocation ("free" meaning no tyranny opinion malus; it still costs Prestige) of all Duke- and King-tier vassal titles, with the *al-Mulk* variant also getting free transfer of vassals.
				All feudal vassals of Duke or King tier who also have *Imperial* government are automatically considered viceroys. This means that, whenever their title is usurped or inherited, the emperor (or their King-tier liege, even if he is also a viceroy) receives an event to assent to their assumption of the title. If the emperor refuses, the viceroy has the opportunity to bribe their liege with favors and/or coin, but failing that the emperor's council will then suggest up to three alternatives - which may include the original heir/usurper if they are liked enough or are the only available ruler in range. The emperor may select one of their options or spend 200 Prestige to override them and usurp the title personally.
				The emperor has access to a 'Make Title Inheritable' option, which will make an *Imperial* vassal change to Feudal government instead - their title will be inheritable and will not need the assent of the emperor from that point on, until and unless it is usurped or revoked by the liege. Feudal government status also automatically applies to rulers who are subjugated through war.
				Note that, when first establishing the *Imperial Administration* law, all vassals will have Feudal government. The only way to turn them to *Imperial* government is through new titles being granted, or existing Duke/King titles being revoked and re-granted by the emperor.
		Restoration of Byzantium:
			Whether it be due to AED (Automatic Empire Disintegration) or plain old history (1204-1261), the Byzantine Empire (ERE) title is often enough destroyed due to loss of Constantinople. In the past, this has often resulted in an irreparable situation for the Empire, especially for the AI. Instead, we'd like to more correctly model the 'Imperial Anarchy' that such a loss would imply, so we've added:
				New decision *Restore Byzantium* will appear for those whom control the Queen of Cities, Constantinople, during such a period of imperial anarchy.
					Its requirements are best explained by its in-game tooltip, but suffice it to say, they're quite flexible but also no gimme; one must indeed re-establish imperial authority before enactment.
					Upon enactment of the decision:
						The ERE title will be restored along with, at the least, its traditional laws: *Medium Crown Authority*, *Primogeniture Succession*, *Free Infidel Revocation*, *Imperial Administration*, and so on.
						Any held, titular empires and kingdoms as well as held, de jure vassal kingdoms of the Empire will be destroyed without penalty.
						Vassalize the Varangian Guard, if they've been formed.
						Vassalize your religious head and grant him Hagia Sophia.
				Two new, tiered 'Imperial Invasion' CBs added to model the 'Imperial Anarchy':
					A CB to invade Thrace and, most importantly, make Constantinople your new capital. While the AI will avoid 'long shots,' this CB doesn't have bordering requirements, is available to any independent ruler that meets the basic requirements of the *Restore Byzantium* decision (religious branch, culture group, etc.), and may even be used against those whom also meet those same requirements. Until the Empire is restored or fades from memory, the de jure Imperial capital will be under constant threat of invasion from Byzantine warlords vying to be the successors to the Empire.
					A CB available only to the currently-legitimate holder of Constantinople which allows invasion of any of the duchies in the de jure capital kingdom of the Empire, and once its counties are all under heel, optionally allows further invasions of any neighboring duchies in Achaea/Morea (SWMH) or Nikaea.
					Note that Papists such as the historical Latin Emperors are not considered "legitimate" by these CBs (or the restoration decision), although a direct path for the titular Latin Empire to become the de jure [Eastern] Roman Empire does now exist if the Latin Emperor should no longer follow the Catholic Pope and practice acceptable Roman customs.
					Both CBs, upon success, will subjugate lords of your specific religion *and will purge the rest*.
		*Protected Council Appointments:*
			This new law offers a permanent opinion boost of +10 from all powerful vassals that are members of the ruling council, current and future, so long as their job security is indeed protected (in addition to a temporary bonus from enactment).
			What's the catch? So long as a councilmember remains "powerful" (as indicated by the in-game "fist" icon), you cannot fire them from their council position -- or you must revoke the law.
			The HRE starts with this law by default.
		Castle cultural building selections now uniformly depend upon their province's culture; the previous, relatively complicated and unrealistic criteria based upon *owner* culture has been removed
	*CHANGES:*
		New Feature: Close relatives of rulers of Duke+ tier in non-tribal/non-nomadic empires with no important job may now decide to "serve the empire" by visiting the ruler's capital. They will ask their liege for permission, and if permission is granted will transfer to the emperor's court for up to five years. They will automatically return if their original liege dies in the interim, but otherwise will return on their own with one of a number of random possibilities such as an increase in their education trait level, a stat increase, a wife or child (oops!), the Depressed trait, etc. They will, however, elect to remain in the emperor's court if they are serving on the emperor's council or as one of his commanders. (brought over from CK2Plus and implemented by @Rylock)
		New Plot: *Overthrow the Empire* plot now available for any member of the emperor's council in *Imperial* or *al-Mulk* governments. Once the plot power has climbed high enough, the coup will be ready to begin and will kick off an event chain where the plotter and conspirators attempt to take over the palace in a pitched battle which could see any of them captured, injured, or even killed (this includes the emperor, unless the emperor is currently away from the capital - which will keep them safe but does make the coup easier). (brought over from CK2Plus and implemented by @Rylock)
		Adult courtiers within the court of a feudal Emperor-tier ruler may gain one of three traits: *Imperial Courtier* (for characters with Diplomacy and Intrigue education), *Imperial Bureaucrat* (for characters with Stewardship or Learning education), or *Imperial Guard* (for characters with Martial education). This gives the characters in question a boost to their traits, but also makes the emperor who has them in his court eligible for a number of "imperial intrigue" events (some of which are good, some bad, though in general having a *lot* of courtiers with these traits will increase the chance of negative events). (brought over from CK2Plus and implemented by @Rylock)
		A Duke- or King-tier vassal within an *Imperial* or *al-Mulk* realm may use a decision to claim the throne if they have 1000 Prestige, 100 Piety, and either the Proud, Ambitious, or Brave trait. The AI will not use this except in exceptional cases. (brought over from CK2Plus and implemented by @Rylock)
		It is no longer possible for a liege to coerce a vassal to leave their chosen 4-interest faction (i.e., Court, Prosperity, Glory, or Tradition) via the standard spymaster job; however, a liege may still coerce vassals out of the standard, conspiratorial factions as usual
		Imperial Reconquest: The CB and related "tier check" decisions/events no longer require complete *holding-level* control to continue advancing through the reconquest tiers; all that matters is that you have complete *province-level* control of each tier before advancing to the next
		The *Theme System* laws for the Byzantine Empire (ERE), a legacy of Project Balance, have been removed
		Reduced the base probability of a battlefield duel by -30%
		Duke- and above-tier AI rulers will no longer marry lowborn spouses (failing all else, spouses will be from the lesser nobility)
		*Late Feudal Administration* law (permanently unlocks advanced succession laws) is now more strict regarding required Legalism technology vs. *Crown Authority*. Essentially, the technology requirements have all been increased by one level, with CA-independent unlock at level 6 while still being possible to unlock at as low as level 3 (see in-game tooltip for breakdown of Legalism tech vs. currently-effective CA).
		In the past, it was possible to bypass *Crown Authority* or *Administration* law requirements when enacting advanced succession laws if no crown law title affected your succession law title. With the advent of *Late Feudal Administration*, this loophole is no longer allowed for Primogeniture/Ultimogeniture, but it is still allowed for Seniority.
		Obligations law sliders now all have unique graphics for each of the 4 vassal classes instead of text; Focus law sliders were already graphical
		Threat / Defensive Pacts:
			Defensive pacts cannot form against a ruler unless their threat level is at least 15% (threshold increased from 5%)
			Reduced different-religion-group defensive pact distance cut-off to 300, which is the same value used for same-religion-group defensive pacts
			The *maximum* amount of threat increase per province conquered in a war is now 4% instead of 8% (vanilla's reference cap is 15%/province)
			Threat loss from granting independence to non-de-jure vassals reduced by -90%
			Threat gained through inheritance reduced by -67%
			Threat will be no longer be gained due to vassals
			AI, when evaluating whether to join/leave a defensive pact, is now less sensitive to distance from the threat than in the previous version of EMF but still significantly more sensitive than vanilla (i.e., they are less likely to take part in d-pacts against distant threats, *ceteris paribus*)
		Custom kingdom/empire formation decisions now only create titular titles; you'll have to drift them into de jure status the normal way
		De jure assimilation of duchies into kingdoms (de jure drift) now requires 75 years of de facto duchy control (instead of 100 years); for reference, recall that in EMF 5.02, the time requirement for de jure assimilation of kingdoms into empires was dropped to 50 years (instead of 100 as well) -- kingdoms drift faster than duchies
		Monthly prestige gain from held count- or higher-tier titles has been halved across the board; monthly prestige gain from vassals, weighted by vassal-tier, has NOT changed, however.
		Prestige gain from creating titles has also been nerfed:
			Duke-tier titles earn you 125 prestige (vs. vanilla 200)
			King-tier titles earn you 250 prestige (vs. vanilla 400)
			Empire-tier titles earn you 500 prestige (vs. vanilla 800, previously 1200 in EMF)
		Prestige costs of destroying titles have likewise been updated to equal the new, lower prestige gains from title creation
		Automatic Empire Disintegration:
			The "de jure" historical empires whose legitimacy doesn't rest upon control of Constantinople (the HRE, its Frankish HRE variant, Persia, and the [restored] Roman Empire) now require higher min. realm size than 100 to be exempt from AED, *unless they have at least High Crown Authority*:
				The HRE variants require at least 200 realm size (300 on EMF+SWMH)
				The [restored] Roman Empire requires at least 300 realm size (400 on EMF+SWMH)
				Persia requires at least 200 realm size
		Added comprehensive all-CBs blocks upon certain targets:
			Non-republican AIs cannot target titles which would wipe-out a merchant republic, although players can wipe them out as they please
			[SWMH] All CBs which operate upon de jure territory (e.g., most invasions, holy wars, etc.) protect against outside forces using them for conquest of the Saharan region (which includes the Kanem/Hausaland kingdoms in the interior), unless the attacker or defender are players, or the defender's capital is itself outside of the Saharan region
			Holy order and mercenary titles can never be contested (esp. important for third-party claims)
			Nomads' landless clan titles and their empire-tier khaganate title can never be directly contested in any form of claim war
		EMF's war AI will no longer be as infamously aggressive against players immediately after campaign start; their preference for giving players hell will return as the game progresses, but we should no longer see any Day-1 DoWs from the AI in certain starts
		Rulers should now "go native" (embrace local culture) less frequently and more rationally
		EMF now actively breaks tributary relations when an independent tribute becomes vassal to another ruler
		For the independence faction, tribal rulers now care much less about whether their liege has de jure pretension over them (will be more rowdy)
		Castle cultural buildings, cultural retinues, and combat tactics:
			Added new cultural buildings, retinues, and adjusted tactics for Castilians, Leonese, and Aragonese cultures (emphasis on heavy cavalry and infantry)
			Made the 'Shock Charge' tactic available to Occitans to put them on par with their French overlords
			Granted the Old Saxons the appropriate cultural tactic for their cultural building/levy composition
			Readjusted Romanian, Russian, and Lithuanian retinues to better complement their army compositions
			Added new retinues for Bosnian, Carinthian, Galician, Cornish, Anglo-Norse, Norse-Gaelic, and Old Saxon cultures
			Adjusted Arab cultural building to restore maintenance values to a reasonable level
			Added North African cultural building & retinues which are more coherent with their Berber cultural tactics
			Adjusted Dutch/Frisian/Low Frankish cultural building and retinues in order to promote synergy with their cultural tactics
			Adjusted Lombard cultural building and retinue to be more aligned with cultural tactic and historical legacy
			Adjusted Albanian retinue for better cultural tactic coherency
		Councillors may no longer be reassigned instantly and require a cooldown of 3 months before redeployment
			Bonus consequence: placing a councillor now lifts the "fog of war" at their location again, as it does in vanilla (with no cooldown, this would've been an exploit).
		(Vanilla Map) Duchy of Aragon de jure moved to Kingdom of Aragon in 1066 and later start dates
		[SWMH] Christian Iberian kingdom dynamic de jure expansion: Duchy of Badajoz is now a potential de jure expansion target for Portugal (3rd in priority after Leon and Castille, respectively)
		Reduced Mongol invasion event troops and reinforcements by -33%
	*MINOR CHANGES:*
		*Council Authority* law has been removed due to serving no practical purpose after other additions & changes in this version
		If using any of the age customization traits in the Ruler Designer, those traits will be immediately removed upon campaign initialization rather than requiring up to an in-game month before removal
		Loot per nomadic population (i.e., when raiding nomadic provinces) has been doubled
		Rulers now have up to 2 months to influence undecided council members' votes after proposing a law change (up from 1 month)
		The 'crowded court' threshold for increasing disease spread chance has been raised by +50% to 60
		The randomized reward event for completing the 'Convert a Province' [religion] ambition is now hidden; the reward will nevertheless apply
		AED (Automatic Empire Disintegration), when trying to select an appropriate kingdom title to which a rump empire should be demoted, now uses the "51% rule" for de jure county control (i.e., more than half) rather than the 50% rule normally used for kingdom title creation
		Mortals may no longer plot to kill the All-Seeing Isis!
		*Convert to Merchant Republic*, the day-1 scenario customization "diplo-action," is no longer an option for rulers of landless tiles -- no Popes, no mercenaries, no holy orders ... and no Isis!
	*MAJOR FIXES:*
		Creating or usurping titles as the Byzantine Empire (ERE) will no longer cause mysterious net prestige deductions
		Various rare but potentially serious issues caused by the succession law overhaul of EMF 5.02 have been addressed with *yet another succession law overhaul*. We've eliminated the possibility of such issues due to using a more "vanilla-friendly" design to achieve the very same goals (with the very minor exception noted below).
			Due to limitations of CK2's succession law system: when enacting a succession law change, it is now possible to spend more prestige than you actually have, which could result in negative prestige. Though this is unlikely to occur when otherwise meeting the requirements for succession law changes, pay mind to the prestige costs of succession law changes in order to avoid negative prestige.
		AED (Automatic Empire Disintegration) will no longer pick fallback kingdom titles which are actually inactive or titular (very rare but major & stupid)
		Fixed the *De Jure Holding War* CB not being available in some cases that it should (and not usurping intended baronies) as well as an issue with the *3rd-Party De Jure County Claim* CB
	*FIXES:*
		4-interest faction demands for their liege to surrender a county title are now WAD
		*Primogeniture Succession* no longer appears as a [disabled] succession law option for Muslims
		[SWMH] Christian Iberian kingdom dynamic de jure expansion: Duchy of Beja now only requires complete *county* control to qualify for dynamic drift (i.e., not necessarily complete subholding control), like the other duchies covered by this system
		Fighter/diplomat traits now properly reference educator skills rather than requiring an actual guardian to be assigned (fixes many kids no longer developing such traits post-Conclave)
		Fixed "government flavor" triggers to work w/ EMF's alternative law setup for *Imperial Administration* and to consider the HRE and alt-history Saint-Empire Romain (western/frankish HRE) titles equivalently
		Corrected some incorrect culture references in 00_combat_tactics.txt
		Removed extra Frisian castle cultural building
		Vanilla fix for missing localisation in the "tournament is over" event
		Fixes for some grammar localisation (incorrect pronouns) in a few of the old Project Balance ambitions
		Succession law factions no longer require their associated laws' additional "allow" conditions to form-- only their "potential" (i.e., such factions now ignore *Crown Authority* or *Administration* laws-- only pragmatically affects Primogeniture and Seniority factions)
		[SWMH] Fixed a minor issue with Frisian provinces converting to Dutch when they should not (e.g., before Dutch culture has even emerged from Frankisk / Low Frankish culture)


EMF 5.02 [2016-03-04]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		Compatible with CKII v2.5.2
			As warned, 2.5.2 added new vanilla personality traits, and this renders old, pre-2.5.2 savegames trait-incompatible (all character traits will be shifted/shuffled in the new version-- NOT recommended)
			See patch 2.5.2's changelog for incorporated changes
		Refactored and expanded law group: *Administration*
			*Early Feudal Administration:* Default equivalent to old *Feudal Administration* but available at all tiers
			*Late Feudal Administration:* Unlocks all advanced succession laws (Primogeniture, Seniority, and Ultimogeniture) independently of Crown Authority
				Its requirements are largely based upon Legalism technology level and the level of *Crown Authority*, if any, affecting the title *at the time of its passing*:
					Legalism tech level 5 unlocks it regardless of CA.
					Legalism tech level 4 unlocks it if affected by at least *Limited Crown Authority*.
					Legalism tech level 3 unlocks it if affected by at least *Medium Crown Authority*.
				Majesty tech level 3 is required.
				Must be duke-tier or higher unless your liege has already enacted the law, in which case there is also no prestige cost for passing it.
				Duke-tier, king-tier, and emperor-tier require prestige costs of 500/750/1000, respectively, to pass the law.
				NOTE: *Medium Crown Authority* and *High Crown Authority* still independently unlock Seniority and Primogeniture/Ultimogeniture, respectively.
			*Imperial Administration:* Equivalent to same-named law of the past, but it now also requires a prestige cost of 1000 to enact
		All non-gender succession laws have been completely overhauled under the hood for greater flexibility regarding manual succession law changes (changing the law intentionally as opposed to by faction demand)
			Succession law changes have a prestige requirement and *cost* that scales with the title's tier (barony/county/duchy/kingdom/empire costs 125/250/500/750/1000 prestige, respectively).
			Succession law change reactions are now far more intelligent, with events to handle disinheritance or being displaced from the line of succession and much more.
			This has required a major overhaul; if you notice any strange behavior relating to succession laws, please report it.
	*CHANGES:*
		Added prestige costs (and requirements) for raising *Tribal Organization* law
		Added prestige costs for raising *Crown Authority* law; the cost is half the required amount, and the requirements haven't changed
		Non-aggression pacts between vassal and liege no longer prevent those vassals from joining factions
			Now that this is moddable, AI vassals will no longer dissolve their NAPs with their liege if their liege opinion is negative
		The *De Jure Holding War* CB can no longer be used to take holdings from vassalized holy orders when it wouldn't be available if the holy order were independent. The decisions to expel the holy orders are still available, for the player.
		In multiplayer, only the game host will be able to use or see the scenario customization decisions
			For *non-hosts in multiplayer*, other decisions that normally would've been hidden until unpausing are now shown beforehand, as in vanilla (again, only relevant to MP).
		[SWMH] The English Melting Pot now also assimilates Anglo-Norse and Danish province and character cultures within the English region
		[SWMH] The Formation of Rum event now also transfers the duchy of Tayk from the ERE to Rum
		The minimum liege levy provided at -50 opinion is now 0% rather than 25% (below -50 opinion, vassals will still not provide any troops); at +100 opinion it is, of course, still 100%
		Slightly less prestige will be gained from battles
		Shattered retreat:
			Movement speed reduced to +30% from +50%
			Maximum chosen path length for retreat capped at 7 provinces on SWMH (-30%) and 6 provinces on the vanilla map (-40%)
		Threat and Defensive Pacts:
			Compared to vanilla, it is less likely for distant AIs to join/stay in a defensive pact, and the current size of a realm is less of a factor whenever increasing Threat level.
			EMF+SWMH behavior also assumes natural realm sizes (number of holdings in the realm) are about twice as large, and the equations for Threat gain and loss reflect that assumption.
		In 4i (4-interest) faction revolts, succession law faction revolts, and faction revolts to lower *Crown Authority*, only rebels that are allowed to inherit feudal titles may usurp liege titles upon rebel success (no prince-bishops, no bishop nominees, no horses, etc.)
	*FIXES:*
		Due to strange behavior in *multiplayer*, battlefield duels have been disabled in multiplayer games (thanks to @Lord of Pain for the report)
		The ambitions to become a councillor (of which there are 5) now properly abort if the character becomes independent


EMF 5.01 [2016-02-16]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		The *Restore the Papacy in Rome* decision is now multifarious
			If the top liege (i.e., ruler taking the decision) has setup an Antipope:
				AND the "de jure" Pope is unlanded, the Antipapal claim will be pressed and Rome given to the new "de jure" Pope.
				AND the "de jure" Pope is NOT unlanded, the decision cannot be used.
			If the top liege doesn't follow an Antipope, Rome will be given to the "de jure" Pope, as per the usual purpose of this decision.
			The new Antipapal logic works for both Catholic (Papal State) and Fraticelli (Fraticelli Papacy) Popes.
		The *Gender Equality* scenario customization decision now sets the *Full Status of Women* law on appropriate titles when "Full Gender Equality" (i.e., the option which includes laws) is chosen
			The newest positive effect of this behavior: Female rulers or rulers with female heirs will no longer suffer any opinion penalties from vassals
	*CHANGES:*
		De jure claim CBs for the county of Rome or duchy of Latium are no longer valid if the defender is the attacker's religious head
		The minimum levy and maximum levy bonuses associated with *Crown Authority* have been toned-down a bit
		*King's Peace* crown laws have been added back into the game for those without the Conclave DLC
		*Title Revocation* law setup has changed:
			If you own Conclave, *Title Revocation* is a demesne law: *Title Revocation Allowed* requires your primary title to either be unaffected by any crown law title or for that crown law title to have at least *Limited Crown Authority*, while *Free Infidel Title Revocation* can only be passed if your primary title is subject to at least *Medium Crown Authority*.
			If you do not own Conclave, *Title Revocation* will once again work as it did prior to Conclave's release (as a crown law).
			Tribals, like nomads, no longer receive a special *Title Revocation* law, as *Tribal Organization* has now been modified to encapsulate that fully.
		The "Become Councillor" ambitions are no longer available for advisers (voters already on the council without a specific council position)
	*FIXES:*
		All council appointment criteria should now be WAD (a bug in EMF 5.0 was leading to, most noticeably, women being allowed as court chaplains!)
		4i (4-interest) factions will no longer inappropriately decide to revolt when their liege's liege has enforced Realm Peace, a situation which would make the revolt war itself impossible
		The Fraticelli Papacy now uses the College of Cardinals (Papal Succession), a vanilla bug/oversight that somehow escaped us for far too long!
		A few minor localisation fixes & improvements (better tooltips)


EMF 5.0 [2016-02-14]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		Compatibility patch for Conclave / CKII v2.5.1
		Conclave-related / differences from vanilla:
			Until patch 2.5.2 is stable with the promised "better infamy," infamy has been nerfed to the point of essentially only serving as a [weak] CB cooldown.
			Units undergoing a shattered retreat only regain morale at the normal rate and not at an accelerated rate; they also have a shorter possible range of provinces to which they're allowed to retreat.
			Members of any of the 4i (4-interest) factions simply want a member of their faction that is a voter on their liege's council; it no longer matters which position per faction.
			Council members may always join the 4i (4-interest) factions regardless of whether the council is content; this exception to the rule doesn't apply to other types of factions.
			EMF's unique *Crown Authority* law and sub-law system has been retained-- as have vassal obligations and every other law but Status of Women, which is locked to the DLC (old rules for gender-related stuff apply when Conclave isn't active)
			Some of vanilla's new ambitions have been retooled, as they weren't very well-implemented at time of release
			Council members that are members of 4i (4-interest) factions will vote upon laws and interactions [partially] according to the interests of their faction
		The Duel Engine is back, and it's better than ever. Let the epic drama on the battlefield (and some other places) flow through you! [Our old version/fork was replaced with CK2Plus's much newer version. Many thanks to our Plus compatriots and the maintainer of the New Duel Engine, @jordarkelf.]
		[SWMH] The titular stem-duchy titles present in the HRE in most start dates (Swabia, Lower Lorraine, Bavaria, Saxony, and Franconia) will now be destroyed if their holder gains the corresponding de jure, king-tier stem-duchy title.
		A same-religion *County Conquest* CB has been given to all unreformed pagans. It works very similarly to the same-religion-group version of Muslims' *County Conquest* CB, but it costs 200 prestige instead of 50 piety to use.
	*CHANGES:*
		The alt-history Frankish/Western HRE which can be formed from the TOG bookmark now has its own dedicated title, `e_hre_french`, rather than reusing the existing `e_france` title
		The AI can no longer use its own version of the [now deactivated] *Raise Tribal Army* decision


EMF 4.05 [2016-01-24]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		Upon reaching adulthood (age 16), male characters with mothers that have strong claims upon titles will "pre-inherit" them as weak claims (does not apply to claims on titles governed by Absolute Cognatic succession law)
		Newborn infants now have a 3% chance of dying during childbirth (stillborn or otherwise)
		For a temporary period following a succession, rulers will be able to raise fewer liege levies than otherwise
		The HRE will have less trouble with Independence factions forming in Italy and especially Burgundy despite not being their de jure liege
		[SWMH] Bookmarks after 1205 restored, as these later start dates are increasingly presentable in terms of coherent title history (some areas still need love in late-era, though)
		To view interest faction mood and membership at a glance, simply view a character in such a faction, and their associated interest faction's icon will display on a color scale of gold (Happy) to red (Angry) in the view's character modifier section
	*CHANGES:*
		The 4i (4 interests) factions (Court, Prosperity, Glory, and Tradition) are now *significantly* more difficult to keep happy all the time due to rebalancing of the aggregrate vassal opinion scale which determines faction mood
			Note that the new scale should be more intuitive for EMF players when considering the various relevant thresholds of opinion already in EMF; the previous scale was calibrated according to CK2Plus's balance, which didn't fit EMF goals very well.
		Base fertility has been reduced further overall
		Magyar event troops will disband upon their initial ruler's death
		Muslims should now be more on par with Christian strength:
			Inter-Muslim wars cost less piety per month
			Muslims gain twice as much piety per month for each mosque in their demesne
			Boost in secondary spouse fertility (still much less than primary spouse fertility)
			Muslims are no longer penalized w/ -10% tax from Muslim provinces (vs. non-Muslim, which receive a +25% bonus)
			Decadence's impact (either positive or negative) upon demesne income has been halved (now +10% to -10% for decadence of 0-100)
			Decadence's impact upon army morale is now never negative, but it can still be positive for low decadence
			Decadence gain from unlanded dynasty members has been dramatically reduced
		Vassal opinion of you due to raising their liege levies for extended periods of time now stacks-up much faster (-1 opinion per 42 days vs. the vanilla 61 days)
		Characters will now considerably more rarely live well into their 70s
		Lovers or concubines (that aren't married to each other) will experience more pregnancies than previously, ceteris paribus
		De jure kingdom titles will now be assimilated by empire titles (de jure drift) in 50 years rather than 100 (NOTE: kingdoms still assimilate de jure duchies after the standard 100 years)
		The College of Cardinals' cardinal & pope selection/scoring mechanism now barely at all factors dynasty prestige of the candidate into the equation (truly should no longer see many Karling/Jimena/etc. popes in mid-to-late stage of a campaign)
		The personal piety of a religious head no longer plays any role at all in their religion's Religious Authority
		Catholic bishops now pay a larger portion of their tax to the Pope if they prefer him over their liege (not as much as pre-2.4, however)
		Patricians now pay only 25% of regular city tax to their liege (halved from vanilla)
		Nomads will now enjoy higher max. population / empty holding slots (moreso on EMF+SWMH)
		Nomads have a clan limit of 12 instead of 9 when playing EMF without SWMH (with it, it was already capped at 12)
		Levies are now more expensive to maintain while raised
		Liege levies now replenish more slowly (as slowly as retinues reinforce in EMF-- 3%/month), but demesne levies continue to replenish faster (4%/month)
		The threshold at which a court is considered "crowded" for the purposes of accelerated disease incidence and spread has been lowered from a court size of 50 to 40
		AI raid aggression has been reduced
		AI willingness to declare war at any given time is now TWICE as much as vanilla (and 67% more likely than prior in EMF)
	*FIXES:*
		De jure expansion of Aragon during the Reconquista now correctly triggers in 2 possible cases that were previously not likely to trigger due to a logic error and in another case which was fully-impossible to trigger (Mallorca)
		Fixed the tooltip for the de jure expansion of Christian Iberia events
		Succession law faction revolts will no longer invalidate for succession types other than Seniority whenever the original war liege (defender) is replaced (e.g., due to death or title usurpation)
		Succession law faction revolts for laws aside from Seniority will now correctly enforce the change in succession law upon rebel success
		Succession law faction ultimatums, if accepted by the liege, now properly change the correct law when the law in question is not Seniority (in which case it already worked properly)
		Fixed a few edge cases not previously handled in the new dynamic civil war system which would otherwise cause incoherent game state (very rare)
		When a vote of no confidence in a 4i (4 interests) faction leader is taken, the faction leader will now correctly vote against the motion rather than for it
		Fixed loophole wherein players could join multiple interest factions at once (though the AI could not)


EMF 4.04 [2015-12-23]
	Due to collaboration with the CK2Plus team (Rylock in particular), EMF now features the jointly-overhauled "interest faction" system from Plus as well as extended civil war mechanics. The system has so many moving parts that an oversimplified summary of the system will have to do for this changelog (pay attention to tooltips for faction mood effects of some your actions or achievements as well as opinion-breakdown tooltips for faction members).
		The new factions (of which virtually every vassal is a member of exactly one):
			Court -- cares most about autonomy and recognition
			Prosperity -- cares most about wealth, order, and sustained peace
			Glory -- cares most about prestige-- their own, their liege's, their realm's-- and are pro-war
			Tradition -- cares about piety & faith, resists change, hates heresy, and prefers the tried-and-true
		Civil wars due to the 4 interest factions (which may have been sparked due to failure to comply with a myriad of possible demands) as well as the generalized Lower Crown Authority Faction and succession law factions now use a much more dangerous, high-stakes CB and feature dynamic call-to-arms as well as post-war rewards/penalties for loyalists/neutrals/rebels and other such tasty Christmas treats.
			If you lose one of these civil wars against rebels:
				Any specific demands related to the civil war will be enforced (e.g., reverting the succession law on your primary title after a change)
				Crown Authority will be lowered on all of your crown titles (if applicable).
				Tribal Organization will be lowered (if applicable).
				All of your counties that are de jure vassal titles to any of the rebels will be surrendered to their de jure liege. Counties that rebels have claims upon will be surrendered as well.
				All of your vassals that are de jure vassals of any of the rebels will be transferred under the rebel with the most specific (lowest-tier) de jure liege title.
				If you are the original civil war defender (i.e., you didn't ascend the throne in the middle of such a civil war), your primary-tier and primary titles may be usurped by rebels with claims on them, that are pretenders to them, or that are heirs to them. **Failing that, you will be forced to abdicate.**
			If you are victorious over such a civil war:
				All of the rebels will be thrown into prison, and what happens to them afterward is entirely up to you.
	[SWMH] Automatic de jure expansion of the Christian Iberian kingdoms (i.e., Portugal, Leon, Castille, and Aragon) has been completely rewritten to be much more fair, lead to a more realistic Reconquista, less railroaded / more flexible in total possibilities for which duchies drift into which kingdoms, and very robust
	If the Byzantines regain de jure Rum, Rum will become titular, with the territory reverting to de jure Anatolia / Konya under the de jure Byzantine Empire
	Galicia, when titular, is now deactivated and destroyed after acquiring a de jure king- or empire-tier title
	The "legal marriage age" and the age at which young adult portraits are shown has been reduced to 14. The age of adulthood (i.e., when the kids may become rulers without a regent) is still 16.
	Some significant "natural selection" maluses have been added to the "dwarf" trait, as due to its relatively high inheritance chance despite low birth incidence rate, we were all too frequently seeing long lines of prestigious Dwarven Emperors and Popes in late-game.
		The Secret Society of Dwarven Aristocracy is nonplussed.
	AI will now always be open to pressing an anti-Pope's claim on the Papal State or Fraticelli Papacy, regardless of whether they'll be able to vassalize the new Pope upon success
	Republics can now seize cities/counties w/i 250 distance of any realm county (instead of 200)
	Vassal patricians in a republic now consider all of the republic's realm provinces when calculating distance to targets for CB restrictions (i.e., all provinces in the Doge's subrealm rather than their own)
	Winning a war or holy war as an ally now always triggers success of their respective war ambitions for all CBs
	The *Imperial Reconquest CB* will no longer automatically usurp Papal State holdings above baron-tier and not in counties that are directly held by the Papal State at all (unless the war is actually against the Papacy)
	Nomadic county liberation now has a truce of 3 years (instead of 5)
	*Muslim County Conquest*, when a religious war and when vassalizing the target rather than usurping the county (due to the target being a count without any other county titles), now gives a proper "Subjugated By Different Religion" temporary opinion bonus (+45)
	Regents will no longer screw with your Crown Authority pathologically
	The *Decadence Usurpation CB* will no longer be capable of usurping holy order / mercenary / religious-head titles (unless same religion for the religious-head titles)
	FIX: Fixed a bug wherein certain AI vassals could use the *Bid For Independence* CB where they should not be able to do so
	FIX: The new *Become King* ambition icon now works properly. Thank you GIMP, for still being junk at exporting DDS
	FIX: Correct event option text when fulfilling the *Change a Province's Culture* ambition


EMF 4.03 [2015-10-23]
	***Province Culture & Religion Preservation:***
		Some of you may have noticed that activation of the Horse Lords DLC erases original (i.e., intended) province culture and religion under nomads to be mono-cultural. We've written a "province history enforcement" supplement called **antinomad** that restores the originally intended province culture & religion under nomads when starting a new campaign with Horse Lords enabled.
			Works as intended at literally all start dates!
			Works for the SWMH map, vanilla map, and even the modified CK2Plus map (**antinomad** was donated to Plus for this release as well-- you've just got to have it, after all); note that EMF and CK2Plus are not compatible, however.
			Will only apply to new campaigns.
			Nomads conquering otherwise "empty" land from a different-culture or different-religion nomad now also kicks-in the new Leave A Tribe Behind mechanic, to prevent automatic province culture/religion erasure due to Horse Lords mechanics.
	***Ambitions***:
		28 (twenty-eight!) new ambitions, often tiered, have been added to ensure that you always have something interesting from which to choose from your ambition list:
			*Become Duke*
			*Become a Great Duke*
			*Become Emperor*
			*Gain Independence*
			*Have Five Children*
			*Have Ten Children*
			*Have Fifteen Children*
			*Have Twenty Children*
			*Increase Size of Demesne:* an ambition for each demesne size of 1-12
			*Lower Decadence:* 7 tiered decadence ambitions that kick-in at 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, and 80 decadence each with the aim of reducing decadence by 10, can be repeated on a 5-year cooldown
			*Assemble a Great Council:* Put together a council wherein no councillor has a skill level of less than 18
			*Change a Province's Culture:* Not too dissimilar from *Convert a Province*, but prepare for a longer wait. If you do want to spread your obscure culture in the game, then this ambition is for you. Note that it applies to any provinces under you rather than just those directly owned by you [player-only].
			*Increase Personal Combat Skill* ambitions have been updated significantly:
				Characters with the new commander minor title are much more likely to want to increase their personal combat skill
				Christian religious heads will never take the ambition
				Ambition now has up-to-date requirements regarding who can lead troops
				General objective AI chance rebalancing
	***Scenario Customization Decisions:***
		*New World Order* has been restored for CKII v2.4/HL.
			You'll now get 3 additional options for how to handle nomads, as they don't follow the normal de jure rules that non-nomads do:
				Make each clan independent-- all vassal clans will become independent, but no new clans will be generated
				Give each clan a single province-- one county per Khaganate, and new clans will be generated to fill the holes (this is the most like 'Independent Counts' for nomads)
				Leave nomads alone-- you guessed it, simply leaves nomadic realms alone
			Now respects the *Gender Equality* customization and generates female rulers at a 50/50 ratio when applicable
			Patricians can no longer use the "Rapid Conquest" CBs
		*Gender Equality:*
			Customization has been revamped, giving 3 independent options:
				Gender-equal council (excludes the Marshal position)
				Gender-equal military (includes the Marshal position and determines who can lead troops / be a commander)
				Full Gender Equality: Every title in the game for which *Absolute Cognatic* succession is an option will use *Absolute Cognatic*, and the AI will never change it back, nor will new titles use *Agnatic* succession when they should use *Absolute Cognatic*
					In addition to rewriting the gender succession laws to make this possible, there are still cases where the hard-code will give *Agnatic* succession to newly-created characters, and these are caught on a yearly maintenance pulse which corrects them to *Absolute Cognatic* if they qualify
			No longer gives access to the buggy *Enatic* and *Enatic-Cognatic* succession laws
	*Council and Succession:*
		Barring other exclusionary rules, all council positions may be held by a woman if cathar, messalian, bogomilist, or mazdaki and their liege is the same religion
		Characters with the monk or nun trait, if other rules allow, will now be allowed to be appointed to the court chaplain position with religions & government forms that otherwise require them to already be a landed priest/priestess (e.g., those with autocephaly)
		Dismissing a councillor that's become incapable or has gone into hiding no longer earns you a "Fired From Council" opinion malus
		"Job Security Concerns" (a small opinion malus earned from a councillor when they're fired and later re-hired) can no longer stack
		Can now jump straight to *Absolute Cognatic* succession if religion is mazdaki in addition to messalian religion and basque culture
		If your religion/culture qualifies for jumping straight to *Absolute Cognatic*, there is no minimum prestige requirement for doing so
	*Religious Authority and Province Conversion:*
		Province religious conversion via the 'Proselytize' job action now always takes +25% more time on average
		Due to an effective imbalance in relative Religious Authority for Muslims:
			Muslims may call Jihad with as low as 30% RA rather than the usual 40% required
			Sunni, Shia, and Ibadi religions receive a permanent +10% religious authority on scenario startup (new campaigns only)
		Provinces under Islamic control now spontaneously convert to the owner's religion twice as fast (was previously very slow) and earn a 5-year +1% religious authority as they would if converted by the 'Proselytize' job action
	[SWMH] Seljuk will no longer spawn in mercenary courts or any other foolish place for launching a subsequent invasion
	[SWMH] *Manifest Destiny Invasion* CB (special invasion CB for Seljuks and Timurids) now targets the whole intended conquest region for both dynasties (did not previously due to lack of all de jure empires in that area on SWMH)
	Leave A Tribe Behind now ensures that the new tribe will be a minor holding in the previously-empty province (not the capital) when the conqueror is nomadic
	EMF's regional weather effects no longer affect Garrison Size, because this can have confusing effects on the locally available levy
	Upon major revolt invalidation, the temporary Levy Efficiency laws that were applicable during the war for the revolt leader and the liege are now, in addition to the other possible war outcomes, corrected immediately
	*Make Tribute* CB will now less commonly be used against players than previously (normally, we encourage AIs to use available CBs against players over other targets, but in this case, it's a bit spammy, because the CB is virtually always available)
	*Make Tribute* CB will be less commonly used by non-Muslim feudal rulers against other non-Muslim feudal rulers
	The decision *Raise Tribal Army* has been removed due to the sheer and implausible advantage and opportunity for abuse that it gives players.
	Characters ages 50+ and especially 60+ have less health reduction due to the 'Old Age' and 'Very Old Age' modifiers, respectively.
	AI will now *prefer* a direct land border (as opposed to traversing a sea zone) when using any of the relevant duchy-tier holy war CBs
	If a reformed pagan, the *Holy War* CB can no longer be used against targets of your unreformed faith
	*Special Holy War* CB can now be used by either any holy order against a target in another religion group or by the King of Jerusalem for a de jure duchy within Jerusalem against a target in another religion group
	*Special Holy War* CB no longer induces a holy war cooldown
	*Religious Reconquest* CB now requires at least one of the same-religion provinces in the target duchy to be non-nomadic
	Non-nomads can no longer holy war for duchies that lack any non-nomadic settlements
	Nomad settlement: more hardcode-induced border gore reduction
	[SWMH] FIX: Standard culture conversion events should now prevent Geat-cultured provinces from flipping back to Norse before their time
	[SWMH] FIX: Culture/religion conversion modifiers to promote inland Turkmenification and discourage it coastally in the Rum/Byzantium areas now work properly again (SWMH EE changed the underlying cultures at work)
	FIX: Properly adjust Levy Efficiency laws for the liege and major revolt leader in the case of 3rd-party revolts (e.g., Claimant wars)
	FIX: Usurpation of single-holding provinces containing a nomad capital should now still Leave a Tribe Behind when supposed to do so (but it won't appear until the next game day)
	FIX: Nomads can no longer use the *Religious Reconquest* CB
	FIX: Nomads settling as merchant republics will now properly use the new post-settlement mechanics
		If a nomad settled as a republic in an EMF 4.02 save, it may have left behind stray game state which could mess with future settlement of the prior nomadic realm's territory, even if as feudal. However, upgrading to this version of EMF will dynamically fix any such stray game state automatically.
	MINOR: Pagan and non-pagan versions of the *Holy War* CB merged into one
	MINOR: Base fertility modifier dropped to -10% from -5%


EMF 4.02 [2015-10-04]
	***HIGHLIGHTS:***
		A new historical CB for the TOG start to promote AI formation of the HRE and a generally more spicey European political climate
			If you definitely want to see an HRE form, a very effective way is to endow a King in the "Frankish Realm" with Lucky Ruler status.
		Major improvements to nomad settlement as feudal, tribal, or a republic (incl. major border gore reduction measures)
		New mechanics for conquered empty provinces and AI nomad behavior which tend to:
			Preserve original culture/religion
			Provide a more natural path for AI and players alike to develop land liberated from nomads
			To much better model the evolution of sedentary customs and governmental organization from the nomadic way of life
		New mechanics for upgrading tribal settlements
		Automatic empire disintegration improvements
		More successful and aggressive Merchant Republics / patricians
		AI Muslims should now live a slightly less punished life and be able to be more aggressive toward each other
		Performance boosts (actually noticeable with EMF+SWMH rather than just a subliminal quality-of-life improvement)
		Major fixes which:
			Enable the Mongol invasion to properly rock all the time
			Enable the Seljuks' dynamic formation of Rum
			Allow characters affected by the Baqt to be played without being spammed with a few hundred events at startup
			Eliminate the root cause of the [vanilla] issue regarding mysterious appearance/accumulation of event troops
			Eliminate dozens of vanilla / patch 2.4 bugs introduced to CBs, in settlement decisions (pillage, conversion of tribal settlements to other settlement types, nomad settlement as feudal|tribe|republic), for all changes of government form, etc.
	***SOME OF THE DETAILS:***
		*HRE formation from 867 start:*
			Rewrote Holy Roman Unification CB to be more permissive, toward the end of promoting unification / formation of the HRE
				CB is currently now AI-only, but a player version will be added again.
				CB is now valid until 967 (100 years from start) OR 30 years following the last successful usage of the CB
				Most of its additional permissiveness is not valid vs. player targets.
				Lucky Rulers are able to use it under many more circumstances than others and will thus be considerably more likely to be able to form the HRE, if they're King of one of the de jure kingdom titles that once constituted the Carolingien Empire / Frankish Realm (France, Aquitaine, Italy, Lotharingia, Burgundy, Germany, and Bavaria).
				Expanded target kingdom preference modifiers to promote better borders, more plausible conquest
				[SWMH] FIX: All of the new German subcultures in SWMH can use it now
			[SWMH] FIX: When forming the western/Frankish HRE, Duchy of Alsace is now properly a de jure vassal of the empire (but Alsace still transfers to the standard/German HRE if it is formed instead)
		*Mongol Invasion:*
			Should now always start conquest in the correct location, and the EMF supplementary AI code ("pillage-burn") for their subsequent invasions will now always be able to do its glorious job
			Supplementary AI code will now respect marriage alliances when choosing invasion targets (hard-coded AI may still attack as per normal, however)
		*Nomads, nomads, nomads:*
			Settlement code rewritten to reduce border gore and increase capital-connectedness of both the settled realm and the prior nomadic realm
			Settlement as a tribe and as a republic now benefits from the same intelligently-clustered culture/religion conversion code that settlement-as-feudal received in the prior release
			Whenever a nomadic province is conquered by a non-nomad, the portion of the original nomadic population which did not migrate upon conquest settles as a small tribe in the province, preserving the original culture/religion and providing a more natural and direct path for further development
			AI nomads will now never destroy the last settlement in a different-culture province by mindlessly burning it all to the ground and will instead prefer to preserve it for more future pillaging (players may choose to raze it all for the hell of it, though)
			The 'Pillage Settlement' tooltips are much more concise and actually correct (e.g., informing you when the settlement is too weak to survive any more pillaging and will be destroyed vs. when only a building or two might be destroyed)
				Consequently, the information now actually fits in the diplomacy interaction window, rather than being unable to see most of it (and the most important parts of it at that)
			The 'Pillage Settlement' decision no longer exhibits a ton of vanilla bugs with some pretty strange and undesirable consequences
			The anti-nomad 'Liberation' CB has been replaced with a custom EMF CB
				It may only be used to conquer one county at a time
				It now requires the attacker to have a direct border with the target county
				It can no longer be used for "liberating" the Sahara Desert
				It is properly hidden when Pagan County Conquest or Muslim County Conquest could be used instead
		*Tribes:*
			Settlement conversion/upgrade no longer also instantly auto-builds a city and temple at no cost/time, a silly behavior introduced in patch 2.4 and now reversed
				Event chains to help bootstrap the ex-tribal county's economy with the foundation of more settlements in a much more flavorful, gradual, and natural manner are coming soon
			Theocracies may now convert tribal settlements to prince-bishoprics
			Settlement conversion/upgrade once already feudal, republican, or theocratic can now also be done for 100 gold, rather than requiring maxing-out the government-type-associated tribal building type (but doing so means that fewer tribal buildings will be automatically converted to their counterparts in the new settlement)
			The levy of a newly-converted/upgraded ex-tribal settlement will now be properly refilled after a few game days, rather than completely depleted
		*Convert to Merchant Republic*:
			Now allows the day-1 diplo-action target or yourself to be feudal OR a regular republican (count-tier)
			If there is no city in the ruler's capital province but one can be built, one will be built and the customization will still be available for that ruler
			No longer allows Muslim targets (in patch 2.4, Paradox disallowed Muslims from having the Merchant Republic government type)
		*Automatic Empire Disintegration*:
			AED now requires the HRE to always have at least 150 realm size (other empires only require 100, except for the ERE / Latin Empire which require Constantinople)
			If AED couldn't find an appropriate kingdom title to fallback upon with its usual methods (that is, neither the ruler's capital kingdom nor any de jure vassal kingdom of his empire title passed the "50% rule" for title creation), it now also:
				Searches every single de jure kingdom title in the game for one which passes the 50% rule (at least half of its de jure counties must be controlled by the emperor)-- very useful if the empire was titular (e.g., just-settled nomads)
				And if that fails too, it creates a titular kingdom title based upon the emperor's capital county title (i.e., its map color will be related to the county's color, its name will be the same, and it will have the same CoA)
		Decadence revolts are now less severe and can only fire when decadence is at least 75% (now closely resembles vanilla)
		Imperial Reconquest CB now additionally usurps the target duchy title if held by a ruler whom was vassalized as a result of the war (instead of only when the enemy top liege directly held the title), if your empire has the Imperial Administration law and the Charlemagne DLC is active (allows conversion to a viceroyalty without tyranny)
		When rulers are over vassal limit upon succession, they'll no longer randomly lose AI vassals unless those vassals are on the border of their liege's [sub-]realm
		Normally, the AI must be of a certain size or tier to purchase retinues (leads to better AI performance, both literally and in terms of how they manage their money and armies). *However*, all AI patricians are now exempt from these EMF restrictions.
		Muslims may now use *County Conquest* against pagans too (with a holy war cooldown, if they're enabled)
		The *Convert a Province* ambition now no longer gives the same "random" reward throughout a ruler's lifetime and is now properly random
		The *Win a War* and *Win a Holy War* ambitions now have zero delay before you can reselect them
		The College of Cardinals now weights the Dynasty Prestige of a prospective Cardinal / Pope -60% less than previously (awarded elector points are now equal to 1% of total dynasty prestige rather 2.5%)
		Muslims at war with each other now only lose 1 piety/month while at war rather than 2; this should promote more intra-religious aggression besides revolts
		*Performance Boost*: the engine will now only evaluate MTTH events for every character once every 30 days rather than 20 (will not affect the statistical frequency of events occurring, only reduce processing overhead-- EMF doesn't rely upon any MTTH events to be evaluated any more frequently than once a month through careful design, so it's a win-win)
		[SWMH] FIX: Moravians now have a cultural retinue: the Rytír retinue of 3:2 knights and light cavalry, like their Bohemian neighbors
		[SWMH] FIX: Turkmen now have a cultural retinue (the same as Türk culture, both of which differ from the general Altaic retinue)
		[SWMH] FIX: Seljuks should now usually succeed at forming Rum from the 1066 start once again (and from pre-1066 if they come into power somewhat historically)
		(Vanilla Map) FIX: Starting a 'Find Title' search with the letter 's' will no longer crash the game
		FIX: Since patch 2.4, the 10-year opinion malus for raising *Crown Authority* or one of the CA sub-laws was erroneously doubled and is now -15 per law/sub-law again
		FIX: Rivalry CB should now work properly with respect to suzerainty
		VANILLA FIX: Ghost armies of event troops belonging to seemingly random rulers should now no longer appear (a root cause that's been present since TOG but apparently only an issue since 2.4/HL)
		VANILLA FIX: Pagan and Nomad Subjugation CBs had several errors and omissions introduced in patch 2.4
		MINOR: Below *Medium Tribal Organization*, any *Tribal Obligations* or *Tribal Focus* laws are removed


EMF 4.01 [2015-09-01]
	Crusader and Mujahid traits no longer award martial skill
	Vanilla map: Duchy of Flanders de jure moved to Kingdom of France
	SWMH map:
		Manual advancement of start date in the game lobby has been extended to 1337.1.1, like vanilla (still no bookmarks after 1205, though)
		Castle cultural buildings and cultural retinues have been added for the new German sub-cultures in SWMH, along with the Szekely
		Gothic/Geat culture now has a heavy infantry cultural retinue
		Cultural modifiers have been streamlined and balanced
		FIX: Romanian and Albanians will no longer have two different cultural buildings, and Albanians now have a retinue
		FIX: Robert Guiscard no longer has an overlapping war (2 CBs at once) in the Alexiad (1081) start
		MINOR: De jure Irish kingdom title no longer automatically destroyed upon scenario start; this should no longer be an issue with SWMH
	Mongol Empire:
		Invasion is now firmly guided to follow historical patterns (almost entirely without railroading it!)
		To address the issue of pacifist Mongols (an extreme problem on SWMH but also an annoyance on the vanilla map), EMF now has supplementary AI code ("pillage-burn") that forces a shock-and-awe invasion with multiple simultaneous wars, relatively smart target selection, and other neat tricks to better represent the extremely aggressive and rapid expansion of the Mongol Scourge.
		Invasion uses a custom CB designed to minimize the unlanding of original characters and their subsequent replacement with Mongol-cultured feudal lords. The Mongols were indeed rather "hands-off" overlords, and it should be much more fun to be conquered by the Mongols (merely the beginning of a new era rather than a reason to ragequit)!
		Mongol Empire will no longer convert away from the Tengri faith until at least 30 years after its arrival.
		The *Conqueror* trait (which makes characters particularly ruthless) will stop being applied to Mongol invaders after the year 1300
	Magyars:
		Starting troops in 867 are now sufficient to beat Bulgaria and properly wreak some havoc on Eastern Europe
		Their 867 invasion now uses a custom CB and extended event chain which properly migrates them in a way similar to that done previously to the release of Horse Lords, and it is much more robust for their purposes.
		Those without Horse Lords are also fully-supported by the new CB, events, and decision.
		Less overpowered than in previous releases (excluding the prior EMF 4.0, which had reverted to the poor vanilla event troop setup)
		Migration code respects player vassals of the Magyars, unlike previous code, and will never eliminate them.
	Elective monarchy faction logic significantly improved, toward the goal of generally reducing the faction's likelihood to revolt
	Robert Guiscard's 5 Norman-Byzantine Wars from 1066 until his death have been removed in favor of an invasion of the Balkans in 1081.4.1 (Alexiad start), for historical accuracy
		However, it is likely that his earlier Italian campaigns against the ERE will receive special treatment (with a custom CB) in the future.
	Rewrote *Remove Ahistorical Empires* scenario customization for more simplicity and robustness
		FIX: Will no longer deactivate an ahistorical empire title if it is actually held (but will still make it titular-- notably affects Abbasids in 769)
	Nomad settlement to feudal:
		Completely rewritten province culture/religion conversion logic (number of provinces proportional to population+manpower) to settle your non-nomadic lands in a much more contiguous/clustered and intuitive, aesthetically-pleasing way. This is also a vanilla bugfix, because their method was completely faulty.
		Players settling-down get to keep their previous demesne nomadic provinces (no point in forcing you to go to Liberation wars to regain control of the land you already controlled directly)
		Nomads spawn 2x less one-time event troops, proportional to number of empty holding slots abandoned, than previously.
	Nomad lucky rulers now gain some significant benefits as well (previously, the status was only a major boon for feudal/iqta rulers-- we're still working upon improving the bonuses for tribals, although it still makes a big difference for them)
	FIX: The per-crown-title lifetime cooldown upon changes to Investiture Law is now properly reset upon title inheritance
	FIX: Can now properly create the Frankish HRE when also using using *Remove Ahistorical Empires* scenario customization decision
	FIX: *Adopt Feudalism* decision should now always be enabled when its tooltip indicates that it should be
	FIX: The Seljuks will no longer immediately lose their titular empire-tier title gained when they first spawn/invade (pre-1066 starts)
	FIX: Some misfiring PB events related to 'retaking the coast' and the Bulgarian unrest have been removed temporarily due to misbehavior
	FIX: All those eligible to be marshals are now also eligible to receive the Commander minor title (prior, many EMF extensions to command eligibility were disregarded)
	VANILLA FIX: Reduced the odds of an AI character with theology focus taking the option to become a heretic from 33% to 20%
	VANILLA FIX: (Hopefully) stopped spurious 'minor clan reinforcements' event for unrelated provincial revolts (stopgap)
	VANILLA FIX: Upon scenario initialization, virtually every king-tier title in the game is given an [uncreatable] placeholder de jure empire when they otherwise lack a de jure empire
		Without this measure, the engine currently appears to have various issues with memory leaks, crashes, and buggy behavior.
		Mechanism for plugging de jure empire gaps is similar to that used for *Remove Ahistorical Empires* (though no titles are deactivated!).
	MINOR: Crown Authority law increases no longer require at least 1 year to have passed since the title holder has changed his/her primary title


EMF 4.0 [2015-08-16]
	Compatible with CKII v2.4.3
	Nomads:
		Settling as feudal or republican now:
			Clusters the provinces converted to your culture/religion (amount dependent upon your population+manpower) to be contiguous and likely centered around the new capital, rather than picked entirely at random
			Actually spawns troops exactly proportionate to the number of empty holding slots which are being "abandoned" (vanilla tooltip lies about this)
	New region-based implementation of EMF's tiered Imperial Reconquest CB (thanks @IoannesBarbarus)
		New *Imperial Reconquest Tier* decisions and utility event chain that explicitly show you what provinces you've yet to completely-control in your current conquest tier. No more endless searching for independent holy order baronies in your bustling empire!
	[SWMH] Bookmarks after 1205 removed due to lack of SWMH support for those later start dates at this time
	HRE formation in TOG start:
		Now has a supporting historical CB for reuniting the traditional Carolingien kingdoms to make plausible formation of the HRE much more likely (eventually)
			Can be used strategically by non-Karlings to have a chance at forming the HRE themselves
			Serves predominantly in the form of an "expanded weak claim" CB, although it does not always require actual claims if the conditions are right
		Now offers a 'Form the Frankish HRE' alt-history option for the Western Carolingien kingdom holders (different de jure setup, etc.)
		Once one of the HREs has been formed, the new emperor will have 10-year time-limited usage of a new *De Jure Kingdom Claim* CB against targets of the same religion group within the empire's new de jure borders
	Vassal limit is now half as valuable relative to demesne cap bonus on the Centralization law slider
	Logic for AI change of Centralization law changed to be much more robust; AI should manage vassal limit more efficiently
	Direct trait-based restrictions upon holy war lifted for AI
	*Third-Party Claim* CB:
		CB tooltip now clearly shows whether the claimant will become / remain or not become your vassal upon successfully pressing their claim.
		Mechanic change: Install claimants *into* other realms.
			When a claimant would not become your vassal after pressing their claim, they may now become the vassal of the prior liege to the title they've claimed. Previously, it was likely that they'd just become independent. If this applies, their new liege will also be clearly shown in the CB tooltip.
		Various AI restrictions removed from using the CB (such as needing certain traits to press claims against "allied" top-lieges), but the AI will now no longer use it at all unless it would gain them territory *EXCEPT* when the war could somehow tangle with a player-- even if just allied with the target-- in the name of chaos promotion.
		AI emperors are normally quite restricted for whom they will push claims (close relatives, same dynasty, friends, spouse(s)), but they will now push claims for any otherwise valid claimant when the defender is a player
	The Jomsvikings can now form after religion reformation just like other pagan holy orders. Vanilla events can still create them earlier. Rejoice, ye armchair Viking warriors.
	Command veteran traits are now harder to gain/advance
	Court Banishment fixes:
		The court banishment action will no longer show up in the player's own diplomatic menu.
		Banished courtiers of a different religion will now always leave the player's realm.
		Players with no vassals in their realm, or with only baron tier vassals, will now be able to banish courtiers properly. However, if there are no eligible courts in their realm, the banished courtiers will leave the player's realm.
	Building tax income and maintenance model:
		Castle, temple, and city buildings which cost maintenance (i.e., all that don't generate tax, except for universities/schools) no longer stack net maintenance cost per building level quadratically (each building upgrade costs the same amount of additional maintenance)
		Income-generating castle buildings (town and walls) no longer ramp-up net tax income with building level nonlinearly (due to the holdings' agrarian, feudal economic model), but relatively, they generate more income than previously early in the game
			Similarly, temple income-generation has been slightly altered to be more linear and favor early and mid-game relative to cities, after which they are definitely outclassed economically
	*De Jure Duchy Claim* CB:
		Now requires Medium CA or greater in the the held de jure kingdom or de jure empire *of the target duchy*
		MAJOR FIX: When the CB was not available due to its [previous] CA restrictions, it would occasionally still appear as a CB (but not usable). More importantly, when it did this, it would prevent valid, corresponding De Jure County Claim CB (which doesn't require CA) instances from being available. [Became an issue a couple releases ago (when crown laws were overhauled).]
	FIX: Proper handling of patrician family extinction in the case of the Doge himself
	FIX: Siege module should no longer allow some type of rebels to take prisoners
	FIX: When using *Remove Ahistorical Empires*, one will no longer see a funky "E-EMF-NULL" on the de jure empires map mode (issue introduced last release)
	FIX: Crier module will no longer announce the formation of the Mongol Empire or general nomadic titles
	VANILLA FIX: The 'Magyar' tribal title is now destroyed and deactivated upon formation of Hungary (could pop back up through elective gavelkind inheritance)


EMF 3.11 [2015-05-08]
	**New feature:** *Banish from Court*
		Players may now banish extraneous courtiers from their courts, assuming that courtier is not a child, not employed officially, and not a prisoner.
		Banished courtiers of the same religion will find another court in the player's realm to call home, while those of a different religion will attempt to flee to another realm with the same religion, if such exists.
	**New feature:** *Expanded decision menu*
		The intrigue screen now features a larger decision menu, capable of displaying 7 decisions at once compared to vanilla's puny 4. It can also now display an additional available and backed plot, which is *definitely* the most popular EMF feature request. You can tell by all the forum threads about it. You're welcome.
		The dimensions of the intrigue screen are unchanged, meaning this feature retains compatibility with the same display resolutions as vanilla CKII.
	**New module:** *Crier*
		Adds some flavorful announcements to relatively rare events in the game world, along with small, related mechanics.
		List of announcements currently include:
			Religion Head sacrificed by another faith
			Empire formation
			Empire disintegration
			Player death (Multiplayer only)
		Other events may be added in the future.
	**New CB:** *Subjugation*
		Usurps no titles, force-vassalizes the target, and gives them a temporary Subjugated opinion bonus (to offset the declaration of war)
		Can be used by duke- or higher-tier rulers against count- or higher-tier rulers of the same religion (though target must be lower-tier)
		*ALL* non-titular, count- or higher-tier titles of the target must be de jure vassals of a title held within the attacker's [sub-]realm (i.e., held personally or by vassals).
		Cannot be used on mercenaries, holy orders, the Pope, etc.
		To be used on counts, no *Crown Authority* is required.
		To be used on dukes, it requires the target to be subject to a crown title held by you or one of your vassals that has at least *Medium Crown Authority*.
		To be used on kings, it requires the target to be subject to a crown title held by you or one of your vassals that has at least *High Crown Authority*.
		This is now a way to vassalize an existing Merchant Republic without destroying it in the process.
	New HRE formation decision and EMF+SWMH de jure setup in the 867 start that should improve how and when the HRE can be formed (new campaign required for proper effect)
	Merchant Republics:
		When a patrician house goes extinct, it is now replaced with what is likely to be a powerful existing vassal of the Doge rather than a pathetic new, random house
			Assassinate your rivals into the ground, if you dare: one goes down, another pops-up.
		*Convert to Merchant Republic:*
			AI patricians in the new merchant republic will now almost surely receive a city of their own, usually converted into a county capital, so they will be far better competition for the Doge as well as more prosperous.
			During republic conversion, extra corner cases more neatly covered when severing ties to previous realm, becoming independent duchy, and ensuring control over all titles in duchy
	New ruler demesne distribution mechanic upon scenario initialization:
		If a feudal ruler has excess demesne capacity at startup, they will seize feudal baronies from randomly-generated feudal vassal barons
		First, they will seize what they can in their capital county (until no more capacity).
		Second, they will seize what they can in their capital duchy (until no more capacity).
		Finally, they will seize what they can in their general demesne (until no more capacity).
		When such a random vassal baron becomes consequently unlanded and is not already assigned as a councillor, they will be killed (fewer living characters).
		Historical barons are exempt.
	Muslims no longer enjoy +1 demesne limit as a religion property
	Castle, temple, and city buildings which add levy_size and garrison_size modifiers have been buffed (returned to vanilla for the most part)
	Realm intrigue (personal + any spouse contribution + spymaster) now inherently improves plot power
	[SWMH] Base, tier-derived demesne limit raised by +1 for count- and above-tier rulers (reversal of change from prior release, SWMH has many small/low-capacity provinces)
	[SWMH] Duke-tier base vassal limit dropped to vanilla (10-- 15 if a great-duke); king- and emperor-tiers also relatively dropped but still greater than vanilla map (each +5 from vanilla)
	[SWMH] Tribal garrison and levy empty holding slot modifiers reduced to vanilla (+50%) while tax left heightened (+70%) due to some province (over-)density issues in Scandinavia
	FIX: *Automatic Empire Disintegration* previously had the potential to grant more than one kingdom (indeed, all de jure vassal kingdoms that aren't held and pass the 50% rule) to the ex-emperor, due to a patch change
	FIX: Command veteran trait effects toned-down to work as originally intended (a code merge error in the last release let some old code into the release; main differences now are no diplomacy boosts at higher tiers and less martial boost)
	FIX: Center "flank" leaders should now also be eligible for command veteran traits, earned through major victorious battles
	FIX: *Free Infidel Revocation* now appropriately gives twice the opinion malus to all ruler classes as *Title Revocation Allowed*
	FIX: *Complete King's Peace* now appropriately gives twice the opinion malus to feudal rulers as *Internal King's Peace*


EMF 3.10 [2015-04-24]
	Updated for CKII v2.3.4
	Siege module updates:
		The AI is now significantly less likely to get permanently stuck In Hiding
		The AI can once again choose to massacre the occupants of a holding at the end of a siege, but is unlikely to do so
		Players will get informed if a massacre occurs at their holding
		FIX: Will no longer confuse looting with recapturing friendly holdings
	Added new trait: Raider. Works exactly like the Viking trait, except made generic and available to other raiding religions. (This is also the first VIET feature imported into EMF.)
	(EMF+ArkoCoA) New compatch EMF+ArkoCoA will only enable random CoA for pagans when co-installed with ARKOpack Armoiries (CoA)
	*Dynamic Flags:* When ArkoCoA isn't used, a pagan England will use its proper non-Christian CoA (and when it is used, all pagan CoA are dynasty CoA, so it isn't an issue)
	Crown laws:
		Like raising Crown Authority, there is now a lifetime, per-title cooldown upon any Investiture crown law changes
			It is independent of the Crown Authority cooldown; a single ruler can raise Crown Authority and change Investiture law on the same crown title
		AI rulers will now more aggressively try to raise Crown Authority as high as possible
		Temporary opinion malus from raising crown authority laws (the master slider or the specific laws) is now applied to *all rulers actually affected by the crown law title* (rather than the title's de jure vassals)
			This includes rulers not in your [sub-]realm (or even your realm at all) but still of your religion.
			In situations where your crown law title applies outside of its de jure territory (e.g., when it is your primary title and the area otherwise has no active crown law title), more rulers will now be upset.
			In situations where another crown law title affects some of the title's de jure vassals (such as a kingdom that you or another holds within an empire), fewer rulers will now be upset.
			Reminder: The applied crown law title for a ruler depends upon the location of his/her capital. Thus, vassals whose demesne or sub-realm span multiple crown law titles in which you raise CA will not stack separate opinion maluses (unless the Elves of Mechanics & Flavor change their mind).
		AI characters are now significantly more likely to want to join/create a faction to lower crown authority if any of their liege's King's Peace laws negatively affect a player's ability to wage war
			This is purely to improve the player-as-vassal experience: AIs are already appropriately upset even if no players are around.
			Note that this modifier was already in place for the faction to lower crown authority, but it has been amped-up significantly.
		FIX: When the AI gains a crown law title from a player through grant/inheritance and that player had not fully enforced all of the title's Crown Authority (i.e., passed all the unlocked crown laws, like *Free Infidel Revocation* and *Internal King's Peace* for a title at Medium CA), the AI will now proceed to pass whatever laws that it can, rather than leave them alone until it next raises CA (or a revolt reduces CA)
		FIX: Title revocation laws were not showing a tooltip indicating that they would incur a 10-year opinion malus (unlike the rest)
	Command veteran traits:
		Military commanders will now distinguish themselves through major victories in battle, earning command veteran traits.
		These traits are tiered; there are 4 of them, each with increasing positive effects.
		The 'Fighter' (personal combat) traits now no longer give martial or vassal_opinion bonuses, as the Command traits now do (martial is about command, not merely personal combat).
		Later, more flavor will be added when earning these traits as well as a chance for the highest-tier commanders to earn weak claims on their liege's primary title as a result of major victories.
	*Remove Ahistorical Empires*:
		Now uses a different technique for removing ahistorical empire titles that persists across save/reload and allows proper de jure empire assimilation
		On the vanilla map, the Wendish Empire, the Empire of Germany, and the three Indian empires will now be properly removed.
		NOTE: Due to a limitation rumored to be addressed in the next patch, the game depends upon certain ahistorical de jure empires being in place for some regionalization (e.g., tiger hunts in India or the AI target title / conquest path preferences for certain CBs).
			Therefore, if you choose to use this customization, don't be surprised if certain region-specific logic doesn't work as expected (the above two cases being the most obvious at the time of this writing), but nothing terribly important should be affected.
	Formation of the HRE will make the HRE de jure instantly on the vanilla map and no longer requires/costs 2 years of income (on SWMH, the HRE is already de jure)
	Halfdan Hvitserk (Jorvik)'s event troops now *ALL* disband once he's at peace. Previously (and in vanilla), a large amount of them remained after their initial scripted invasions, wreaking havoc on Britannia for untold decades. Screw that guy.
	Inter-Muslim war now costs 2 piety/month (now the vanilla rate, previously drained piety half as fast)
	[SWMH] Base, tier-derived demesne limit lowered for count- and higher-tier rulers to their vanilla values (previously, they were +1 from vanilla map)
	Demesne limit bonus for rulers with Gavelkind or Elective Gavelkind succession significantly increased (+50% of base, tier-derived limit-- vanilla is +30%)
	Tribal stuff:
		Vanilla's *Build Zeal* job action (Court Chaplain) fixed-up to be more efficient and, most importantly, actually correct about the conditions for spawning and disbanding holy warriors (behavior should now make a lot more sense)
			TIP: Be sure to get involved in a religious war (any CB that is technically a holy war, of which there are quite a few), even as an allied participant, against a primary defender/attacker that is not of your religion by the time exactly 1 year has passed since the Zealots spawned. If you are *not* in such a religious war 1 year after they spawn, prepare to be judged.
		[SWMH] Bonus to demesne limit for tribals increased to 3 from 2 (SWMH has many small provinces)
		[SWMH] Levy, garrison, and tax bonus for each empty holding slot in a tribal province increased to +70%/slot from +50%/slot (same reason-- smaller-capacity provinces in typical tribal areas)
		Base levy of tribal holdings slightly boosted
		Base income of tribal holdings boosted; note that this raises the value of raiding them too (most non-Norse tribes have no other raiding options).
		Pagan Warrior Cult buildings have been removed for being needlessly punishing to Pagans who manage to convert to Feudalism.
			Coincidentally, with no cult to attend, Pagans now have a lot more free time and have taken up cooking and are thinking about getting a couple of rescue cats or a puppy.
	Reintroduced tax-generating 'Port' coastal city buildings and tweaked related city buildings
	Improved the efficacy of 'Construction' technology (now -4%/level on construction time and cost)
	Due to continued vanilla event chain bugs with the 'do_no_disturb' flag preventing certain decisions (e.g., pilgrimage) from being available indefinitely, EMF now forcibly removes the infamous flag if it's persisted for more than 2 years.
	Can now change WoL character focus after 3 years (was 4, and vanilla is 5)
	Councillors can now be instantly re-assigned without cooldown (needed for a feature described below, and previous cooldown was only 3 weeks anyway)
		To completely avoid an exploit that would be worsened by this, councillor deployment no longer lifts fog of war
	*Grant Recently Acquired Land*:
		In multiplayer mode, the high-priority version (i.e., when it displays an alert, which is only when you're over your demesne limit) will stop automatically granting provinces once you're no longer over your demesne limit
			If you want to continue granting provinces anyway, simply reinvoke the decision (though the high-priority alert will disappear)
		Now generates a decent starting council for all new, random characters as well as boosts one of their non-stewardship attributes by +5 (stewardship is already their specialty)
		Now respects the *Gender Equality* customization as well as simply having Absolute Cognatic, Enatic-Cognatic, or Enatic succession:
			Wherever appropriate, males and females will be generated with 50/50 odds (for new nobles as well as their councillors)
		Advanced feature: Mark provinces to keep with your chancellor (especially helpful for multiplayer, because multiplayer land distribution is one-click-- unlike singleplayer).
			To prevent a recently-acquired province from being considered by *Grant Recently Acquired Land*:
				1. Deploy your Chancellor with the 'Improve Relations' job action to any province in your demesne with the *Recently Acquired* modifier.
				2. Go to the decisions menu, and there will now be a new decision titled, e.g., *Keep Zeeland* with the same icon as *Grant Recently Acquired Land*. If it's not there, your chancellor is deployed incorrectly. Remember, provinces in your capital duchy are never distributed with *Grant Recently Acquired Land*, so don't even bother trying to 'Keep' any provinces in your capital duchy even if they are recently-acquired: don't worry, they're safe.
				3. Enact the decision to remove the *Recently Acquired* modifier from the province, making it no longer an automatic grant candidate.
				4. Repeat for any other provinces which you'd like to keep.
				5. Use *Grant Recently Acquired Land* as usual to grant whatever remains.
			Remember, in singleplayer, even if you don't use this advanced feature, you are still given the opportunity to skip granting any recently-acquired province when prompted for it. However, it is perfectly fine to use this in singleplayer as well.
	Merchant Republic CBs:
		Closed a "premature leapfrogging" loophole in the way the Seize City and Seize County CBs measured distance
		Removed AI trait restrictions on the Seize County CB
		Can now offer to join wars (both sides) with the Seize City or Seize County CBs (mostly for MP)
		Warscore earned from battles doubled in the Seize Trade Post CB (occupation warscore unchanged)
	Tribal Invasion CB:
		AI target preferences (encouraged conquest paths) for the il-Khanate, Golden Horde, and the Magyars now properly soft-coded in a way that will work on both SWMH and vanilla maps and is no longer heavy-handed
		No longer vassalizes the holder of the target de jure kingdom, even if he wasn't participating in the war
		Cleaned-up a lot of old code related to revolter subjugation and other vestigial stuff that doesn't matter anymore (but would have strange side-effects)
	Feasts and Hunts will now cancel immediately if there is an on-going war when they are scheduled to occur.
	AI will now occasionally shed an excess personality trait when they have 6 or more personality traits
	Summer Fairs will now delay until a summer without war.
	Republic city tax bonus modifiers (apply to province-capital holdings that are cities) reverted to vanilla values (previously were more liberal than vanilla in EMF)
	FIX: Attempting to imprison vassals would sometimes result in them declaring a war that would immediately invalidate
	FIX: Decision title for multiplayer *Grant Recently Acquired Land*, low-priority version (used when not over demesne limit), now correct (was showing `emf_autolander_auto_low_prio` instead)
	FIX: Cultural tactics now properly effective against standfast tactics
	FIX: il-Khanate, Golden Horde, and other landless empire titles now properly destroyed by *Automatic Empire Disintegration* under the right conditions
	VANILLA FIX: Decision *Restore Pope in Rome* is now player-only, and if the current holder of Rome is a vassal of the player, they must be AI-controlled. [Stops endless loop of de jure wars for Rome followed by granting the land right back to the Pope automatically.]
	VANILLA FIX: Decision *Restore the Ecumenical Patriarchate* no longer makes Hagia Sophia the capital barony of Constantinople. [Because that's, er, weird, and the AI shouldn't be entrusted with such matters.]
	VANILLA FIX: Event which ends a feast prematurely due to war now properly clears do_not_disturb flag
	MINOR: Removed various Papacy/anti-Papacy fixes/workarounds, as they should be addressed in patch 2.3.4


EMF 3.09 [2015-04-06]
	Adjusted Russian cultural combat tactic (now embolon_charge_tactic)
	FIX: Distribute Recently Acquired Land: Bug where the grant candidate's name on the event option did not match the tooltip, portrait, or actual grant
	FIX: Fixed Standfast combat tactics not being properly vulnerable due to a typo
	FIX: Fixed Greek cultural combat tactic (now embolon_charge_tactic)
	FIX: [SWMH] Restored certain Italian culture group retinues
	FIX: Independence faction will not fire without at least 100% faction power (previous behavior)


EMF 3.08 [2015-04-03]
	Crown Law Overhaul: Authority, Succession, and New Mechanics
		Crown laws have been overhauled to merge the classic configurability of PB/EMF-style laws with the strategic and challenge benefits afforded by usage of a "master" slider to represent Crown Authority itself.
		The Crown Authority slider unlocks different laws which can be passed (or not, if you so choose) at each level as well as different succession laws, casus belli, and other effects.
		Crown Authority may only be raised once per title per lifetime, while individual laws such as 'Free Infidel Title Revocation' or 'Protected Inheritance' may be configured at will without cooldown as long as the title has sufficient authority.
		All increases in crown authority, either directly through the master slider or through individual laws, incur a 10-year opinion malus from all de jure vassals of the title.
			If you've already raised Crown Authority and create a new crown title (rather than usurp, inherit, or otherwise gain it from another character), your lifetime cooldown is transferred to the new title automatically (no more exploitative creation with temporary primary titles nor being able to raise your primary title authority twice in one lifetime when creating an empire).
		Whenever a crown title is usurped (by any means whatsoever), its Crown Authority is automatically lowered by one tier, and all of its laws are adjusted accordingly.
		The Autonomy Faction has been disbanded and been replaced with a custom, realm-wide faction to lower crown authority (which is much more effective and correct than the one in vanilla).
			AI will be much more willing to wage a civil war to lower crown authority against lieges whom hold crown law titles that affect at least one player with any of the "King's Peace" laws (even when the player doesn't qualify for the faction).
			Unlike vanilla and the Autonomy Faction, the new faction allows rulers to revolt against vassal kings whenever the vassal kingdom's crown laws do indeed apply to the prospective faction member. Both vanilla and the AF only allowed such revolts against independent lieges.
			Unlike vanilla, the new faction isn't tied to a single crown title. Therefore, in realms where there are multiple crown titles, the whole realm can still unite in common cause to reduce crown authority, although their individual willingness to revolt is still largely dependent upon whichever crown laws affect them (and how much their particular interests are at stake due to them). Vanilla's faction model is fundamentally ineffective in such realms, because any given per-title faction will always be dwarfed by the rest of the realm, even if the majority of all vassals do want to revolt.
		Succession law requirements are now more tightly tied to crown authority, and the rules have now significantly changed. Summary:
			Primogeniture now requires High CA (4/5).
			Ultimogeniture now requires High CA (4/5), with the exception of Mongols.
			Tanistry remains unrestricted, for players.
			Feudal Elective, as it should be, is always an option (unless an unreformed Pagan or a Muslim, of course).
			Seniority now requires Medium CA (3/5).
			We will no longer see, e.g., the entire HRE switch from gavelkind straight to primogeniture directly after the Emperor passes but a single crown law.
		Each level beyond Autonomous Vassals (1/5) grants an additional +20% boost to the crown's minimum liege levy (i.e., makes the crown increasingly less dependent upon opinion to raise same-size armies), up to +80% at Absolute CA (5/5).
			If you should so choose to use your authority to pass the laws, Internal King's Peace will add +10% and Complete King's Peace will add another +10%. In other words, 100% (i.e., at maximum Levy Efficiency, a liege levy unaffected by vassal opinion) is possible at Absolute CA (5/5).
		Each level beyond Limited CA (2/5) provides an extra demesne size bonus to the crown, up to +3 at Absolute Crown Authority (5/5).
		Each level beyond Medium CA (3/5) provides a +20% boost to the crown's maximum liege levy, up to +40% at Absolute Crown Authority (5/5). Note that the maximum liege levy malus due to a large/huge realm size (Levy Efficiency) is only -50%!
		The "Emperor's Peace" laws are gone now. Whether you're an emperor or a king, the law is simply "King's Peace," and this means that when you create an empire, this law setting will properly copy to the empire instantly.
		Old savegames will automatically upgrade all crown titles to an appropriate Crown Authority slider setting, based upon their previous laws. No legal rights of the crown will be lost.
	New module: Sieges.
		Replaces the old Waylit Dungeons and Sieges system. Sieges now function differently depending on whether they're happening due to regular warfare or looting.
		During regular warfare:
			The capture of nobles and their families is common. Once a siege begins, any rulers present will have to choose whether to stay or attempt to escape. If the owner of the barony is present, their choices will determine the fate of both themselves and any of their family who are also present. If the owner is gone for some reason, any family present at the siege will try to escape on their own, but with reduced odds of success.
			Unlike the previous system, characters don't hide at the siege but instead attempt to escape it altogether. If successful, the escaped character will get the In Hiding trait. If unsuccessful, they will be stuck at the siege until it ends, whether by being occupied or the enemy army breaking off. If you fail to escape the siege, and then the enemy army breaks off for a while before returning and resuming the siege, you will get another chance to escape.
			At the end of a siege, the owner of the occupying army will get a chance to decide the fates of anyone captured within. Note that choosing to slaughter everyone present has been slightly altered compared to before. It no longer includes the ruler of the barony in the massacre, even if said ruler is present, and it causes somewhat harsher opinion penalties. The AI is currently blocked from committing massacres, but that functionality will be restored in a future update.
		Looting:
			During looting there are no defender events. It's assumed that rulers and their families are relatively (but not entirely) safe from the raiders. There are also no choices for attackers at the end of the siege; instead, anyone who was captured at the scene is automatically taken prisoner.
			The odds of being captured are low for rulers and anyone with a dynasty. They go up if you're lowborn, are a bishop of a religion different from the raiders, or are a woman and the raiders are Pagans or Zoroastrians.
			There are also a couple of new mechanics associated with looting. Non-tribal looters who capture a bishop of their own religion will usually get asked to release that bishop and refusing to do so will cost a small amount of piety; the AI will always choose to release. Additionally, any player who is non-tribal and either not Pagan or reformed Pagan will lose piety (and the Zealous trait!) if they loot temple holdings of their own faith.
		Other changes:
			Compared to the old system, there will be fewer prisoners taken overall, and much fewer when looting.
			All of these mechanics respect the In Hiding trait, along with all the pilgrimage traits. A character is also not counted as being present at a barony when they're a councilor on the job in the province.
			Most of the immediate trait gain or removal effects have been removed. There may still be consequences or rewards for behavior seen as especially notable, but they won't manifest immediately. (Obviously choosing to slaughter captured folks at the end of the siege is one of several exceptions.)
			Flavor text is now dynamically adjusted depending on many different circumstances.
			Numerous bugs with the old system are fixed or avoided altogether; the most important of which being that it's no longer possible to easily blitz the capital of the primary participant in your war and capture them; while it's still very much possible to win a war by capturing an enemy ruler in a siege, it's now considerably more rare.
	Merchant Republics:
		New customization decision *Rules for Merchant Republics*:
			Normally, republics are limited to a maximum of Limited Crown Authority. If the option to unlock laws is chosen, republics may raise crown authority like any feudal ruler. Likewise, they may become the target of factions to lower crown authority.
			Normally, republics are limited to standard claim CBs and the 3 republic CBs (Seize Trade Post, Seize City, Seize County). If the option to unlock CBs is chosen, they may use any CB that they may use in vanilla.
			Rules can be changed after initial customization.
		Extended pagan CBs (Subjugation, Holy War, County Conquest, Tribal Invasion, etc.) and a few Muslim CBs (e.g., County Conquest) have been further restricted for merchant republics, unless the aforementioned customization option to unlock their CBs is used.
		The two main republic CBs (Seize City, Seize County) no longer require that the target be adjacent or within 2 seazones. Instead, they're restricted by a maximum map distance of 200. [For the curious, this corresponds to 200 pixels' distance on map/provinces.bmp]
		Muslim patricians / merchant republics can now use the Seize County CB on different-religion targets like all other republicans.
	Distribute Recently Acquired Land:
		FIX: Resolved OoS (source of a desync) when used in multiplayer.
		In singleplayer, per-province prompts are now more informative with regard to the province in question and relations to the potential existing characters to which you may grant it.
		In multiplayer, land distribution is now completely one-step, automatic. All recently-acquired provinces still in your demesne that aren't in your capital duchy will be granted, so make specific grants first.
		Only shows up as a high-priority decision (i.e., with an alert) when over demesne limit. Otherwise, it's still available in the decisions menu (without an alert), if you still want to use it.
		Duration of the 'Recently Acquired' modifier greatly lengthened to 4 months (from 2 weeks) to make it much more usable in multiplayer.
		In singleplayer, it now allows multiple rounds of province granting by remembering recently-acquired provinces which were skipped.
		Whenever possible, it will now automatically switch province capitals to match your character type (castles or cities).
		No longer shows your primary heir as a potential candidate for province granting if your succession law is gavelkind or elective gavelkind.
		Likewise, if you are a doge, your current heir (to the republic) is of your dynasty and not already landed, and the county in consideration for grant does not have a city capital, then they are blocked from the list of potential grant candidates.
	Dynamic CoA rules (for England, Aragon) should now take effect immediately upon reloading a savegame (rather than waiting 0-2 years for maintenance to correct the CoA)
	The Execute all Prisoners decision now only charges piety for executing prisoners who are not your religion and indicates in the tooltip which prisoners will cost you piety or give you the Kinslayer trait.
	The Ransom All Prisoners decision has been overhauled. It now features logic more closely resembling the in-game ransom button, so both the AI willingness to accept requests and the value of the ransom should be more accurate.
	The Exchange Prisoners decision has been removed due to its pointlessness; distant dynasty members everywhere weep for its loss.
	Added Suebi, Pictish, and Germanic castle culture buildings and updated Indian castle culture building to the PB/EMF model.
	Players now have access to several new diplomatic actions towards their prisoners: They can freely move their own prisoners between house arrest, a regular dungeon cell, or the oubliette. In addition, they can now request that a vassal transfer any prisoner who is a primary participant in the player's war. (AI still has their own prisoner transfer, but it works by event for greater efficiency.)
	Blinding, Castration, and Zun Judgment of prisoners are now diplomatic actions for players, reducing intrigue menu clutter
	Absolute Cognatic succession law can now be passed without enabling the global Gender Equality customization (simply requires prestige and progressive reform from Agnatic-Cognatic)
	Women can now fill any councillor position (except for Court Chaplain) if their employer's gender succession law is Absolute Cognatic
	Monthly prestige for Chancellors, Marshals, and Stewards doubled, Spymaster and Lord Spiritual almost-doubled (half the monthly prestige of the former group) -- one-time lump sum bonuses upon hire unchanged
	Councillor ambitions now properly abort whenever a character no longer meets the requirements for being hired for that particular councillor position
	AI will no longer take councillor ambitions unless the currently-employed councillor of that type has no more than 3 of the relevant skill points' advantage upon the hopeful AI character
	Making your special buddy, the AI, less of a pathological serial killer (and a better spy):
		In vanilla, the murder event which can trigger due to the Intrigue focus's 'Spy On' action has no AI weighting (intelligence) upon the decision to pursue murder. In EMF, the AI weighting of attempting murder has now been tied to logic very similar to traditional murder plot targeting, with some modifications to further reduce pathologies / wiping out whole families (will generally only attempt to kill when they actual stand to gain in terms of improving inheritance odds for themselves, children, etc.)
		AI with the Intrigue focus is smarter about using 'Spy On' to attempt to recruit faction members (now specifically targets those that aren't in the factions that they lead, rather than simply those that aren't in factions at all-- which was essentially nobody due to the Autonomy Faction containing virtually everyone)
		AI lieges with the Intrigue focus no longer tend to unnecessarily 'Spy On' Autonomy Faction members but instead focus upon conspiratorial factions only (which also reduces pesky serial killing further)
	Players must now be Bulgarian or Serbian to create the Bulgarian Empire
	FIX: Tribal shipyards now have the same number of tiers as feudal or merchant republic shipyards
	FIX: Error in standard Holy War CB that would cause it to sometimes be mysteriously unavailable due to, apparently, the Baqt Treaty being active
	FIX: Feudalized tribes will now have proper investiture law
	FIX: Restored retinue filter to several new Charlemagne retinues
	FIX: Feast, Summer Fair, and Hunt decisions should now work properly
	FIX: Upon Magyar settlement in the Carpathian Basin, baronies that don't yet exist (aren't built) are no longer granted to the ruler chosen to take their non-Russian provinces in the Steppes (usually the Pecheneg Khan)
	VANILLA FIX: Corrected typo in vanilla 00_plots.txt file


EMF 3.07 [2015-02-27]
	Feasts, hunts, etc. costs are proportional to income again (rather than flat rate of 25 gold)
	AI can no longer create custom kingdoms/empires (will reconsider if Paradox ever fixes so-called "k_dyn_XXXX" bugs/oversight)
	[SWMH] Base vassal limits raised to accomodate SWMH map/title differences (Duke +5, King +5, Emperor +10)
	AI can no longer successfully fabricate claims on a merchant republic's capital county (player already couldn't due to restrictions on where a chancellor may be placed, but AI is apparently ignoring the restriction due to a major engine bug)
	Pagan title CoA will now be based upon the ruling dynasty (like Muslims)
	AI will now pay the same prestige/maintenance cost as players when using the 'Raise Tribal Army' decision
	AI will now only use the 'Raise Tribal Army' decision when it's fighting a player (otherwise, it's better that the AI generally save its prestige to develop its holdings)
	FIX: Fixes for Seljuk Invasion of Anatolia -> Formation of Rum event chain and removal of Byzantine independence event chain (for Cilicia and Antioch, mostly), which was causing very strange behavior
	FIX: MAX_LEADERSHIP_TRAITS reduced to 2 (vanilla) due to a bug with the vanilla events for awarding them
	FIX: Bulgarian Empire title history fixed
	FIX: [SWMH] The Seljuks are again the emperors of Persia in the 1066 start (for a couple versions, they'd only held the Kingdom of Persia title)
	FIX: [SWMH] The HRE is again the de jure empire everywhere it should be after the New World Order customization decision is enacted. To restore it as such in existing NWO savegames on SWMH, invoke 'event emf_nwo.100' on the console. [Fix-up event will be removed in future versions.]
	VANILLA FIX: Duke tier or higher AI characters will no longer randomly convert to other religions when asked by friends
	VANILLA FIX: All vanilla event files with improper non-breaking-spaces instead of spaces have been fixed and overridden (44 event files). Should fix a lot of vanilla issues.
	MINOR: Issue with inheritance of loan and marriage decisions menu toggle state fixed
	MINOR: Invalid ai_ambition character modifier for the Sunni/Shia religions removed (was showing up as 'NONE: +5.00' in the religion tooltip)


EMF 3.06 [2015-02-08]
	[Scenario Customization Decision] New World Order
		Give the map a facelift in a myriad number of new ways at any start date with this powerful new customization decision.
		Dismantle the Christian empires (or just the HRE, or the Persian Empire, etc.) and add lots of new kingdoms within which to politick in its de jure kings mode.
		Or, shatter the world (or just a part of it) into independent counties or duchies and use [optional] rapid conquest CBs to etch your own New World Order.
		Invoke the decision multiple times in a row with different selections to terraform the map in more complex ways. Combine it with other customizations such as the day-1 'Convert to Merchant Republic' diplo-action, 'Feudalize Tribes,' or 'No CB Cooldowns.'
		Unless you choose otherwise, players always get preference over AI rulers for de jure duke/king selection.
		AI de jure duke / king random selection preference is first for current/previous de jure rulers (if the player so chooses), and whenever there was no preexisting de jure ruler, feudal > tribal > republic > theocracy.
		All affected rulers surrender all but their capital province to local province barons, even in de jure dukes / kings modes. However, when in de jure dukes / kings modes, starting rulers get strong, pressed claims on the counties that they surrendered.
		If an AI ruler's starting capital is not the province in their demesne with the most holdings, they will move their capital to their best demesne province before surrendering their extra counties. Player capitals are never automatically relocated.
		When in de jure kings mode on the VANILLA map, de jure duchies will be auto-distributed to vassals whose capital is a given duchy's de jure capital. [Avoids vassal limit bootstrapping issues.]
		When in de jure kings mode on the SWMH map, due to a major SWMH limitation, the above will be the case for some kingdoms (or selected duchies within them) but, otherwise, the remainder/all of the duchies in a kingdom will be given to their de jure king for manual distribution.
		NWO replaces Shattered Balance:
			The old "Rapid Conquest" CBs from Shattered Balance have been retrofitted (albeit lightly) and are now rid of a number of old bugs (e.g., no more usurpation of the Ecumenical Patriarchy, Papal State, or other weirdness).
			No more support for the "immortals" option (sorry! EMF must politely insist on your death-- as many times as possible!)
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Feudalize Tribes
		This scenario customization decision allows you to instantly feudalize all tribes.
		Also, it automatically builds a random but plausible distribution of additional castle, city, and temple holdings within the once-tribal provinces.
		Want a slice of what Russia or any other such now-tribal region used to be like in 1066 or 867, before the map changes due to Charlemagne? Here you go.
	*Dynamic Flags:*
		For certain titles, the CoA for the title will be automatically adjusted according to certain dynamic rules (currently based upon holder culture and dynasty)
		NOTE: Flags will only be updated immediately upon title inheritance, usurpation, creation, and on scenario startup. Otherwise, any other changes may take up to 2 years to be reflected.
		For the [Christian] Kingdom of England:
			If the holder is a de Normandie, Plantagenet, or Norman-cultured, the Plantagenet Lions will be used
			If the holder is Saxon-cultured, the Saxon Dragon will be used
			If none of the above, the Cross of St. George will be used
		For the Kingdom of Aragon:
			If the holder is a de Barcelona, the dynasty's classic heraldry will be used
			Otherwise, the default flag will be used
	Previously defunct decision to 'Bring Child Home' restored in the form of a same-named diplo-action & special action alert: Kids in the wrong court (but not prisoners)? Bring 'em home.
	[SWMH] Starting forces of the Normans, Saxons, and Norwegians in the Stamford Bridge start rebalanced
	When negotiating to drop decadence ("straighten-up"), Ibadi/Kharijite targets now have a choice to join the Haruriyyah holy order like Shia/Sunni muslims do (vanilla omission)
	Magyars no longer spawn additional event troops when they take the decision 'Create Hungary'
	Magyar settlement event upon taking the decision 'Create Hungary' rewritten to be more robust and always find an appropriate ruler(s) to take the old Steppe holdings of the Magyars
	SPECIAL_TROOPS_GRAPHICAL_FACTOR reduced to 4 from 20; players should see a lot fewer camels and horse archers on the map (and will see Byzantine Cataphract models with the right DLC)
	Decision menu toggle state is now inherited upon player character death rather than resetting for each new character
	'Conscript Merchant Ships' decision no longer shows at top of decisions menu unless actually at war
	AI tribals can now also use 'Raise Tribal Army' decision (spend prestige for a fixed-size mercenary unit while at war)
	*Distribute Recently Acquired Land:*
		As options for a county grant, decision no longer shows prisoners that are otherwise "best-fit" characters
		Localisation of "best-fit" character options now includes their name (as well as their clickable portrait) and no longer suggests they're from your court (might be a vassal)
	Higher-skilled chancellors no longer have a chance to fabricate a duchy claim if the targeted duchy is held by a merchant republic and it's their capital duchy
	Natural death chances at ages 60-100 are now higher
	Bishops now pay only 5% of their normal tax to an anti-pope if they are loyal to him rather than their liege (down from 10%, which is the amount the real Pope receives)
	DOW_AGGRESSION_FACTOR raised to 0.6 from vanilla 0.5; the AI will be 20% more likely than vanilla to wage war when it has sufficient conditions (a CB, adequate troop ratio, etc.)
	FIX: Rulers should no longer be converting to Judaism due to courtiers
	FIX: Decision to 'Go on Hajj' for Muslims now works without the WoL theology focus
	FIX: Isis can no longer be seduced
	VANILLA FIX: Invalid Papacy claims (generated due to papal succession bug) cleared routinely to prevent wanton antipapacies
	VANILLA FIX: 'Antiking Faction' CB and 'Depose Antipope' CB now have a workaround for the vanilla bug that's been rendering them useless since patch 2.3
	VANILLA FIX: Removed 3 invalid vanilla event references from on_actions (could potentially cause random behavior, although none has been observed)


EMF 3.05 [2015-01-24]
	VANILLA FIX: When using the 'Business' focus, no longer will rulers open up trade routes with landless characters such as Isis or rulers such as the Pope if, e.g., Muslim


EMF 3.04 [2015-01-23]
	Distribute Recently Acquired Land: Now shows clickable portraits for the [up to] two "best-fit" characters options for title distribution in its per-province prompt
	EMF no longer uses any title history from Project Balance
	Jewish councillor events now include an option to refuse and, if accepted, give appropriate sympathy traits and opinion modifiers so that the Jewish characters are more useful as councillors
	Great Goddess Isis will no longer pick a WoL focus
	Don't even think about 'pollinating' Isis
	FIX: There should no longer be any issues with certain cultures using the wrong unit models when using either the vanilla or SWMH map (!)
	FIX: Great Goddess Isis's sexy new custom portrait is now actually working (again, thanks to Crakdtoothgrin for the portrait art!)
	FIX: Magyar "settlement" event should now properly work


EMF 3.03 [2015-01-16]
	Updated for CKII v2.3.2
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Convert to Merchant Republic
		This scenario customization decision converts your feudal ruler into the Doge of a new, independent, and optionally de jure kingdom-tier merchant republic.
		The 4 rival patrician families will be auto-generated by the game once you unpause. Similarly, note that you also cannot build trade posts until immediately after unpausing the game (day 2).
		Cool extra, related feature: there is now a special 'Convert to Merchant Republic' diplo-action available upon essentially any coastal feudal ruler (but only before unpausing the game). With this diplo-action, you can create AI merchant republics-- and still choose whether they're de jure kingdom-tier or simple duke-tier-- wherever you damn well please all over the map.
	[Scenario Customization Decision] No CB Cooldowns
		You may now choose whether to disable all CB "cooldowns" (for all rulers) before unpausing via the decisions menu (affects holy war, county conquest, republics, subjugation, tribal invasion, etc.)
		Can be enacted at any time but is currently irreversible once enacted
	*More Crown Authority, More Money*
		All non-default increments of crown authority laws now grant an additional +2.5% feudal, city, and clergy tax. This can add up very quickly, especially for feudal tax in large realms.
		If you can set legal precedent in favor of the crown on any subject (protected inheritance, internal king's peace, etc.), it is reasonable to expect that the same crown would be able to require / demand slightly higher taxes, ceteris paribus. Naturally, raising crown authority also reduces vassal opinion and may put you at risk of revolts (just as always), so the pay-off isn't fundamental.
		This makes pursuing centralization of power with the crown a more lucrative business, if nothing else. While each crown law has always had its strategic benefits, it has never been more clear that centralization of power with the crown is, in essence, *theoretically* good for the crown.
		Now perhaps you can finally afford those shiny retinues in order to crush the consequent rebellions of disempowered nobles! [ More work to be done soon on better rebellions, though! ]
	*Distribute Recently Acquired Land*
		Decision now also works for counties acquired through inheritance
		Cosmetic improvements (some automatically-generated tooltips were misleading, and a [wrong] character portrait was shown in the main province-prompt event under certain conditions)
		Once decision is taken, it will now prompt for the full set of recently-acquired counties and no longer stop once your character is no longer over their demesne limit. Simply choose not to grant what you want to keep, and remember, even if it's recently-acquired, you'll never be prompted about anything in your capital duchy.
		Now also searches your court for up to 2 best-fit candidates for each province and allows the option to select one of these instead of a new, random character when prompting for each province
		Now applies the proper Indian caste trait to newly-created characters, if relevant
		Newly-created characters will have a stewardship education rather than a fully-random education
		Vanilla's 'Ask For Help Managing Titles' decision is now disabled unless your chancellor is another player; EMF's decision is safer and more reliable
	*Ruler Designer Unlocked*
		There is now no need to use external mods such as "Ruler Designer Unlocked!" with EMF (no age costs).
		You can add whatever traits to your character that you please and set whatever character properties that you like. Ruler-design responsibly, *ahem*.
		You may customize your age exactly from 16-79 with any combination of the 6 age customizer traits in the Ruler Designer (+1 year, +2 years, +4 years, ..., +32 years). These "age traits" are removed from your character within a few days of unpausing your game.
	Great Goddess Isis of Duat now has her very own sexy portrait set and a proper Ancient Egyptian religion icon (portrait art thanks to Crakdtoothgrin!)
	AI rulers won't use de jure county claims, de jure duchy claims, or third-party de jure county claims to conquer AI merchant republics' capitals unless they are themselves another merchant republic and not part of the same greater realm
	AI decision to seduce as well as tendency to pick the seduction focus has been yet further nerfed
	When using the Pagan Subjugation CB, it is now only necessary to share a border with the enemy in the target kingdom-- not to actually be landed within the target kingdom too (plus some other changes)
	Independence Faction is less likely to jump the gun on ultimatums at relatively low faction power ratios
	[Ambition] Disabled Find Hobby ambition when Way of Life DLC is active; Find Hobby is not currently compatible with the Way of Life lifestyle trait distribution method
	OPTIMIZED: Dynamic levy efficiency laws are now only applied to a ruler's primary title rather than all primary-tier titles and should automatically copy whenever their primary title changes (plus other optimizations)
	OPTIMIZED/FIXED: AI no longer uses employment decisions to randomly spawn courtiers of various types, as in vanilla-- far fewer random courtiers will be spawned and may fix a stability issue
	FIX: Religious Reconquest now, like standard Holy War, allows Reformed Norse to wage war over sea zones
	FIX: Bulgarian Empire title creation conditions now consistent with other empire titles (minimum realm size of 120)
	FIX: AI Lucky Rulers are no longer subject to trait restrictions when attempting to use the Pagan Subjugation CB _outside_ their capital de jure kingdom (same restrictions as players)
	FIX: The Autonomy Faction's remove_internal_peace CB had 3 on_add sections (duplicate); it now has one, as it should
	MINOR: Vassal AIs must be king-tier or higher to fabricate claims outside their realm; however, vassal duke AIs may do so as well if the target realm's top liege is a player (like previously)
	MINOR: All councillor ambitions use expectation_of_liege = yes to hint the AI


EMF 3.02 [2014-12-23]
	Seduction:
		Optimization of the seduction focus's CPU overhead (reduced the amount of conditions that need to be constantly evaluated by any given AI considering other AIs for seduction)
		If the target is chaste, you cannot seduce them if they're married or already have a lover
		AI will not seduce zealous, non-pagan married women-- thanks to cybrxkhan's STOP (Stop The Orgy, Please!) mini-mod for this idea in particular (the rest of STOP's rules are now covered by EMF too, though with some differences)
		AI is now interested in targets that have the *cough* 'Well-Endowed' (fertile) trait from VIET (worth half as much as Attractive targets); if target has both traits, the weighting stacks additively
		AI won't pick the seduction _focus_ if craven
		If AI already has at least one lover, it must be lustful to pick the seduction _focus_
		If AI has at least 3 lovers, it will never pick the seduction _focus_ (and cancel it once cancellation is allowed, if already picked)
		AI base rate of seduction reduced by approx. 3-fold
		Unless AI is lustful, they will not seduce anyone if they already have a lover
		AI will never seduce if they become infirm after focus selection
		AI will not seduce targets that are celibate, eunuchs, or infirm
		AI will not seduce if the target has a negative VIET congenital trait that makes them unattractive (e.g., wrymouth); vanilla already does this for its relevant negative congenital traits
		AI will be 1/3 as interested in seducing any given target for each additional lover that they already have (multiplicative stacking)
	Focus can be changed once every 4 years rather than 5 now
	Various minor defines tweaks
	FIX: Rebel leaders should now be able to raise levies of fellow revolters
	MINOR: Decision 'Found a Merchant Republic' now converts the capital _holding_ of the tribe to a city rather than converting the capital _province_ to a republic (should be equivalent, but map issues can affect this)


EMF 3.01 [2014-12-19]
	New 'Bless With Luck' and 'Remove Luck' diplo-actions for Lucky Ruler assignment now take into account whether you're at war with the target character
	Province religious conversion via councillors is now significantly less rapid
	Special province religious conversion rules for Rum, coastal Turks, and inland Turks made specific to the Anatolian / Byzantine / Rumite geopolitical situation rather than applying everywhere
	Dynamic levy efficiency (dynlevy):
		For players, efficiency changes are now instantaneously reflected by changes in realm_size (updates while still paused; no longer need to wait 1 game day to see changes)
		For AI, dynamic levy efficiency law recalculations are now no longer triggered within a day of any title transfer and instead more efficiently recalculated in batch on a periodic pulse
	EMF now uses vanilla merchant republics
		Gotland, the Hansa, and Amalfi return. The other custom republics, with the exception of those in the Indian Ocean, were largely no longer functional after patch 2.2 (Charlemagne) in any case.
		Rather than add more custom merchant republics statically, a scenario customization decision is being considered to enable dynamic merchant republic creation/conversion in-game wherever desired (coastal only).
		Nevertheless, more custom merchant republics may still be added yet.
	Succession laws:
		Forced the HRE to stick with feudal elective succession for AI emperors (though succession law factions can still form and force a change)
		Opinion modifiers further tweaked for the available feudal succession types to improve balance and worthwhile strategic diversity. Notable changes:
			Regular gavelkind is now the most attractive from a vassal- and dynasty-opinion standpoint (and its +30% demesne bonus).
			Primogeniture is not without its sacrifices.
			Seniority is now significantly more viable than previously. Consider trying this some time if you haven't, especially if you're breaking out of a tribal or gavelkind situation with many disparate titles held by separate dynasty members.
			Feudal elective no longer awards vassal opinion, as this is frankly a nonsensical CK2 tradition. If de jure elector vassals were an opinion class that could be targeted by law, then it could make sense to award [i]only them[/i] opinion. However, this is not possible, and even so, the case for any bonus is still weak for a feudal elective title, a title whose consitituent de jure electoral titles' consensus upon succession is fundamentally more legitimate than all hereditary claim to it. [If anything, elective lieges ought to think slightly higher of their de jure elector vassals (the reverse).]
				Expect more changes regarding feudal elective in the future to reduce its potential for abuse and more appropriately model the legal/philosophical implications of such a law.
		Removed some vestigial references to the believed-no-longer-necessary 'Decentralized HRE' law in succession law requirements


EMF 3.0 [2014-12-18]
	Compatible with CKII v2.3 (Way of Life); not backwards-compatible with older versions of CKII
	Title-specic malus in the form of the 'Decentralized HRE' law experimentally removed; it should no longer be necessary due to more general balancing mechanic improvements in this version
	AI Lucky Rulers:
		Now unencumbered by any trait restrictions in all CBs, just like players
		Bless With Luck: One can now assign Lucky Ruler status to a specific ruler via this new diplomacy action (regardless of whether the Lucky Rulers scenario customization decision was taken, so luck can now be precisely assigned)
		Remove Luck: Having second thoughts? You can always remove Lucky Ruler status at will with this new diplomacy action.
	Muslim County Conquest: AI restrictions for usage when an inter-religion war greatly lessened (player usage unaffected)
	Warrior/Fighter traits now factor into WoL personal duel system and their bonuses were tweaked a bit
	Defines (variables which factor into various base game formulae) changes:
		Holding levy sizes now half as influenced by the martial stat of the particular holding owner (HOLDING_LEVY_SIZE_OWNER_MARTIAL_MULT = 0.75, HOLDING_LEVY_SIZE_OWNER_MARTIAL_BASE = 0.025)
		Nobles are more likely to choose to personally command their soldiers when a liege raises their levies (OPINION_WHEN_MARSHAL_INSTEAD_OF_SELF = 0)
		Vassals will no longer provide any liege levies at all when their liege opinion is below -50 (MIN_LEVY_RAISE_OPINION_THRESHOLD = -50)
		Vassals will provide a minimum of 25% of their liege levy obligation at the new -50 liege opinion threshold for levies (with linear scaling above the threshold). E.g., -100 to -49 opinion nets 0% levies, -50 opinion nets 25% levies, 0 opinion nets 50% levies, 25 opinion nets 62.5% levies, 50 opinion nets 75% levies, and so on (MIN_LEVIES_ABOVE_OPINION_THRESHOLD = 0.25)
		When unloading troops (e.g., raiders) from a galley, it now takes twice as long as previously, so it's now the same as vanilla (ARMY_UNLOAD_MOVE_COST = 20.0)
		When loading troops (e.g., raiders) back into galleys (when the ships are not in port), it now takes twice as long as it did for them to unload (ARMY_LOAD_MOVE_COST = 40.0)
		Capturing the heir of your enemy during a war is now "only" worth 30% warscore instead of 50% (CAPTURED_HEIR_WAR_SCORE = 30.0)
		While levy reinforce rates are the same (4%/yr base), vassals' reinforcement of their liege levy contribution reinforces 25% more slowly than their personal levy (LIEGE_LEVY_REINF_RATE = 0.03)
		Vassals pay 20% less for levy maintenance when the levies are raised by a liege rather than the vassal personally (LIEGE_LEVY_COST_MULTIPLIER = 0.8)
		Viceroys (including minor/duke viceroys) provide 20% less liege levies, ceteris paribus-- now the same as vanilla (LIEGE_LEVY_VICE_ROYALTY_MULTIPLIER = 0.8)
		During civil wars, the revolt leader will be able to raise more troops than normal from his fellow revolters (REBEL_LEADER_MINIMUM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1.25)
		More severe penalties to liege levy contributions depending upon how far they are away from the liege's capital. Strict distance is not used for these penalties; instead, "concentric rings" of decreasingly-concentrated de jure territory tiers with respect to the liege's capital county are used. EMF was (and still is) much less severe in these penalties than vanilla because of its additional 'dynamic levies' (or, 'dynlevy') mechanic which also scales down effective liege levies with realm size. However, some adjustments were in order to better achieve EMF's goals:
			CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1 (was 1.15)
			CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.8 (was 0.9)
			CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.5 (was 0.8)
			OUTSIDE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.5 (was 0.7, now no extra penalty for your capital being in an area of the map with no de jure empire-- also just a lot less arbitrary)
		Weakened medium-to-large lieges' levy potential when spreading development over their entire capital duchy rather than concentrating on their capital county; there are still major levy bonuses for capital county, now neither bonus nor penalty for capital duchy, and appropriately-varying penalties elsewhere (CAPITAL_DUCHY_LEVY_MULT = 1-- was 1.25, CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1-- was 1.15)
		Some strategic notes:
			One still has every incentive to completely control their capital duchy (i.e., all province capitals) in order to maximize tax income due to more vassal barons. If your capital county has a lot of capacity and your demesne limit is scarce, the trade-off between maximum taxes (spread yourself over duchy) and levies (pump capital full of castles) is your choice to make. Also consider that retinues are very expensive but have obvious military advantages over levies.
			Keep in mind that the aforementioned, dramatic capital county levy bonuses (as well as the de jure tier liege levy penalties) apply to EVERY ruler-- not just you; therefore, it is extremely beneficial to total realm levy power to maximize the demesne efficiency of all your vassals by ideally limiting every ruler in your realm to a single county (regardless of tier).
			Viking raiding parties now face more serious risks, as they cannot instantly escape the moment you send an army their way. When raiding as a Viking, you're going to need to use more realistic tactics and target selection to plunder and pillage with the best.
			Capital selection matters a lot. Don't be afraid to move your capital. Unless you happen to start with an ideal capital, you should probably move your court at least once. In some areas of the map or upon major conquests/inheritances, it may be beneficial to do so a number of times. Remember, the de jure setup around the capital is critical-- not just the province and encompassing duchy.
			Be more wary of overextending your realm territorially. Upon reaching monumental sizes, something to consider would be spinning-off independent kingdoms that will aid you more efficiently in war.
	FIX: Automatic empire disintegration should no longer create titular kingdoms when searching for a valid king-level title for the emperor upon which to fallback
	FIX: Pagan holy war now costs only 200 piety the first time and then 300 piety thereafter (was costing 500 piety instead)
	FIX: You may now properly press third-party (for a vassal) de jure claims on counties and baronies against different-religion holy orders
	FIX: Peace pledge ambition is now properly enforced by third-party claim CBs (cannot even attempt to press de jure claims or regular claims for a subject character while peace pledge is active)
	MINOR: AI now actually always prefers to 'Press All Claims' rather than press them individually
	MINOR: Eliminated needless exceptions for Byzantium & Roman Empire from all 5 de jure claim CBs' tooltips


EMF 2.06 [2014-12-07]
	Cleaned-up tooltips for 'Adopt Feudalism,' 'Found a Merchant Republic,' and all laws which are unlocked by technology (visual improvement, less redundant)
	Magyar starting troops/commanders boosted so that they can actually win their 867 invasion of Pannonia/Hungary (has been impossible since patch 2.2)
	If startinIg at a bookmark in which Hagia Sophia is controlled by a Catholic, it will be automatically granted to the Ecumenical Patriarch to avoid early mending of the Catholic Schism
	EMF 2.05's hack to improve AI raid targeting by enabling prepared invasions for all pagans has been reverted (caused more issues than it addressed)


EMF 2.05 [NO OFFICIAL RELEASE]
	Maintenance event which kills useless, auto-spawned courtiers (no claims, no skills, etc.) moved from yearly pulse to 5-yearly pulse
		Cuts down on the dead character count as the campaign progresses, because they quickly respawn (optimization)
	Succession law opinion modifiers and requirements reworked to provide more strategy and clarity while also being more robust
	Raiding:
		Looting is again allowed for the reformed version of pagan religions. If players want to do it, so be it.
		Due to a bug in CKII 2.1.1 regarding AI raid targeting, all pagan religions capable of raiding have prepared invasions temporarily enabled. If non-Norse, don't expect it to work, but it's necessary to make the AI properly raid at this time. Additionally, note that this will cause coastal, non-Norse pagans to also raid via boat from time to time, although they won't be able to navigate rivers. Please refrain from reporting this as a bug; it is a hack to fix raiding for the AI in Charlemagne that will hopefully be removed soon.
	AI Lucky Rulers:
		Now much more likely to join and create independence factions
		Now able to use the 'Bid For Independence CB' against AI lieges even when a de jure vassal and regardless of their traits
		Can fabricate minor claims (via chancellor-- not plots) a bit faster
	Automatic Empire Disintegration:
		FIX: 2.04's change which prevented automatic disintegration for the first 30 years of any campaign should now work properly
		As a special case, the HRE now requires a 150 realm_size minimum after the year 1100 (rather than 100 realm_size)
	AI 'Conqueror' trait now has a pretty icon
	Independence faction now just a bit more rowdy in the face of a competing claimant faction (or the possibility of one)
	Decadence revolts can now kick in at 60% decadence, are much more likely to happen at higher levels, and are more dangerous
	Norse conversion to Catholicism now much more likely after 930, also reversed a related major vanilla bug with Norse conversion likelihood
	FIX: Haruriyyah holy order now comes with enough galleys to transport itself (vanilla bug)


EMF 2.04 [2014-11-19]
	Full CKII v2.2.1 compatibility
	Reformed pagan religions can no longer raid unless tribal
		Otherwise, raiding's just plain overpowered and against the spirit of reformation, especially with same-religion raiding in CM.
		Note that Reformed Norse can still jet through major river systems as they please.
	Automatic Empire Disintegration:
		Rump / broken empires are now exempt from automatic disintegration for the first 30 years of any campaign.
		Bulgarian Empire will now have a chance to survive and thrive.
		Mongol Empire (see the dedicated bookmark-- not the usual Mongols) will now have time to establish itself.
		For Latin Empire starts, Byzantium will have three long decades to reclaim Constantinople before losing empire-tier status.
	A new 'Conqueror' trait is now automatically applied to AI horde invaders to ensure that plunder and rampage fills their hearts
		Only affects AI disposition (no trait bonuses).
		Automatically removed when they convert to a less aggressive religion (except for the Timurids) or become incapable.
		Fear the Mongols / Timurids / Aztecs! Fear!
	AI Lucky Rulers now more aggressively pursue what they want as well as independence if vassal to another lord (no new bonuses)
	Cutting down on needless vanilla popups by converting them to notification events which appear in high-priority messages tab instead
		Job: Marshal: Levy reinforcements letter event converted (and duration of modifier doubled to two years)
		Job: Lord Spiritual: Indirect province religious conversion (done by a vassal's lord spiritual) letter event converted
	Muslim County Conquest, when a holy a war, now properly allows neighbors of the same religion of the defender to join the war
	Default Obligations/Focus demesne laws can/will now always be passed if no other laws in their slider group are set
		Prevents "locked law" issues which can occur when, e.g., usurping a higher-tier Muslim title as a non-Muslim or vice versa
	The effects of province conversion on religious authority have been dramatically decreased
		The prior religion (the one which was converted) no longer receives a negative RA hit upon conversion.
		The new religion (the one to which the province converted) only receives 1% RA for 5 years rather than 20 years.
		Hopefully, this better balances religious authority in the 1066 start while still reflecting an authority boost from conversion


EMF 2.03
	Full CKII v2.2.0.4 beta branch support and compatch
		No longer works without opting into the CKII beta branch on Steam (2.2's initial release was broken)
	Unreformed pagans may now adopt feudalism or republicanism (tribal opinion malus still applies, though)
	De jure empires now require a minimum realm_size (number of holdings in realm) of 120 to create
	Custom empires still require 180 realm_size, but if you you hold 3+ kingdom titles, then only 120 realm_size is required
	Technology tooltips for unlocking decisions/laws now properly shown (underlying issue fixed in recent beta patch)
	Added Lombard and Visigothic cultural combat tactics
	(Vanilla Map) Major adjustment to de jure structure of Byzantium with new campaigns
	VANILLA FIX: Closed loopholes on merchant republic Doges passing seniority succession on their primary title
	[SWMH] FIX: A few recent defines.lua changes were out of sync with the main version
	FIX: Holy war was costing more piety than advertised


EMF 2.02
	VANILLA FIX: Workaround for all laws/decisions enabled by technology not being usable regardless of tech level
		'Adopt Republicanism' requires Trade Practices level 1
		'Adopt Feudalism' requires Noble Customs level 1
		'King Viceroys' requires Legalism level 4
		'Duke Viceroys' requires Legalism level 8 (unless playing the ERE or 'Imperial Administration' has been enacted)
		Centralization slider levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 require Legalism levels 1, 2, 3, and 5, respectively
		'Imperial Administration' requires Majesty level 5


EMF 2.01
	First feature-complete release for Charlemagne
	CKII v2.2 (Charlemagne) Compatibility Patch Continued:
		Full CKII v2.2.0.2 beta branch support and compatch
		Full CKII v2.2.0.1 beta branch support and compatch
		FIX: Minor province settlement graphics issue
		FIX: Syntax error in a presently unused trait definition
		FIX: INTER_MUSLIM_WAR_MONTHLY_PIETY_COST = 1 (was accidentally doubled in compatch)
	(Vanilla Map) Adopted fresh landed_titles (de jure structure and title definitions) from vanilla (with modifications)
	Imperial Administration can now be unlocked with near-maximum crown authority (but the ERE gets it for free)
	When forming a new empire, King's Peace laws are automatically translated into Emperor's Peace
	Children will now have a chance to express some 'nature' (vs. 'nurture') personality traits automatically at a young age.
		The trait selection is strongly influenced by both the traits of the father and the mother-- not by the guardian.
		Mom's personality traits actually matter to your kids' future now, so marry wisely.
		Should see fewer annoying vanilla ward events and a more plausible personality development process rather than the usual vanilla breeding program.
	Ibadi holy order rebalanced to fit EMF's holy order maintenance/size standards.
		They get galleys enough to transport themselves and are composed of archers, light cavalry, and camel cavalry.
		Their maintenance-normalized size is double that of either of the 2 Sunni or Shiite holy orders, because there is no second Ibadi holy order.
		The Haruriyyah also now simply require that Muslim jihads have been unlocked to form.
	Combat tactics and special_troops upgrade
		Camel cavalry should now be a lot more effective in combat than previously.
		FIX: Vanilla's special_troops (elephants, camel_cavalry, and horse_archers) maintenance and skirmish/melee/pursuit attack/defense values reverted to intentional, pre-2.2 values.
	Province religion conversion now affects religious authority (+1% per province converted, -1% per province led astray-- heresy appearance doesn't count)
	Provinces of different culture, culture_group, religion, or religion_group now cause small local_revolt_risk in addition to their numerous other maluses
	Councillors again lift Fog of War when assigned; multiplayer exploit no longer an issue due to the inability to instantly reassign councillors (now requires min. 14 days)
	Sieges take 20% less time to complete, ceteris paribus.
	Battles against religious enemies yield less piety (-33%).
	Laws:
		Slightly more forgiving vassal opinion modifiers for all Obligations slider increments (+2 opinion)
		Fresh succession law implementation, simpler approach than PB to requirements for passing these laws
		FIX: For a Decentralized HRE or an ERE which hasn't even partially reformed its Themes System, Obligations law sliders cannot be raised
		FIX: Patricians now always have access to the Obligations/Focus sliders.
	MAJOR: Countless other undocumented, though *usually* relatively small, changes.


EMF 2.0
	Updated to CKII 2.2 and added support for all of the Charlemagne (CM) DLC content
	[Decadence] As promised, with the advent of CM, decadence has returned! Woe!
	[Decadence] Drunkard trait no longer treated as if it were charitable or diligent trait (vanilla bugs)
	In approval of 2.2's changes, EMF and vanilla now have an identical retinue model
		Cost is a bit higher than previously, although it's very close in nature to the prior EMF model
	AI prisoners will essentially never request better accomodations if you're at war
	Spymaster 'Study Technology' job action now fires less frequently and doesn't scale as well with spymaster intrigue skill
	Crusades now unlock if either the province owner OR his top liege aren't Christian for Braunschweig, Cologne, Paris, Toulouse, and Provence
	Rulers less likely to declare independence from their religious head if the religion has at least 40% authority
	Research points 'ahead penalty' raised to 40% per level beyond ideal year (previously 30%)
	Children are now only inherently liked by +10 opinion (except when they're a liege) rather than +15 opinion
	While doing a sweep for consistency and completeness for the 2.2 patch:
		The Anti-King Faction should now be prioritized in realms where an antipope is installed
		'Coastal County Republic' CB is now open to Muslims if the defender is also a Muslim
		'Coastal County Republic' CB may now only be used upon provinces that are adjacent or up to 2 sea zones away from the attacker
		'Duchy Adventure' CB toned-down a bit (minor)
		Can no longer ask to join a war being waged with the 'Pagan County Conquest' CB
		When subjugating rulers directly, the 'Tribal Invasion' CB now appropriately applies 'Subjugated' or 'Subjugated by Same Religion' opinion modifiers
		AI behavioral guidelines added to many CBs to improve AI war declaration plausibility
		FIX: Though it should have been released with Rajas of India, one may now wage war with the 'Buddhist Holy War' CB
		FIX: Pressing another's claim now always earns the correct opinion modifier (not de jure claims, which were fine-- personal claims)
		FIX: Claimant faction wars or otherwise pressing a third party's claim on your liege now properly respects the cooldown on [forced] loss of Crown Authority
		FIX: Merchant Republic AIs should now use their CBs more effectively
		FIX: Duke- or higher-tier vassals can choose independence after a successful tribal invasion (yep, decadence invasions are back for now)
		FIX: A number of achievements that were previously not fulfilled when their conditions were met are now properly fulfilled [NOTE: We still don't encourage Ironman]
	Due to a bug that breaks triggered modifiers in patch 2.2:
		The ERE's 'Disorganized' triggered modifier that lasts from 1066-1081 no longer exists (non-critical malus to army morale and morale recovery rate)
		Decentralized HRE and Themes System laws have been refactored as demesne laws rather than crown laws (superior approach, so net win)
	FIX: Weather module would sometimes fail to apply or regionally spread a province modifier for Heavy Rains


EMF 1.03 [final version for CKII 2.1.6]
	[SWMH] Empire disintegration, for empires not dependent upon Constantinople, kicks in at the same realm size minimum as for the vanilla map (100 holdings)
	FIX: Temporary revolt title dynamic levy laws now properly adjusted for faction size upon third-party claimant faction war declaration and immediately cleaned-up after the war (like all other types of faction revolts)
	FIX: 'De Jure County Claim' CBs for counties already covered by a valid 'De Jure Duchy Claim' CB are no longer listed, as previously intended (minor)
	FIX: Clarified requirements for attacking holy orders w/ SoA enabled for the ERE in third-party de jure claim CBs (minor)
	FIX: Third-party CBs (e.g., pressing someone else's claim) should now properly fulfill the 'Win a War' ambition


EMF 1.02
	Culture technology has been partially reset to vanilla: Noble Customs, Popular Customs, and Religious Customs again grant 2 opinion points per level rather than 1
	Military tweaks:
		RETINUE_FROM_REALMSIZE = 4.0 (-33%, vast majority of retinue cap comes from developing your demesne holdings anyway, so this is minor)
		RETINUE_REINFORCE_RATE = 0.03 (25% slower to reinforce, and this now properly makes them slower to reinforce than levies while at peace)
		COMMAND_MODIFIER_MARTIAL_MULTIPLIER = 0.05 (-33%, return to vanilla, incredibly high martial will no longer stack so strongly with leadership command modifiers)
	Research points 'ahead penalty' raised to 30% per level beyond ideal year (previously only 20%)
	Looting (actually completing sieges while raiding) is now considerably less profitable (raiding itself remains the same):
		LOOT_TAX_MULTIPLIER = 1.0 (-50% base gold derived from tax income of holdings)
		LOOT_BUILDING_MULTIPLIER = 0.015 (-25% extra gold derived from total cost of all buildings in holding)
	New decision: Distribute Newly Acquired Lands. Automatically distribute recently-acquired land, until you're no longer above your demesne limit
		Provinces remain marked 'recently acquired' for 0.5-1.5 months; it is intended to be used while paused after a war, but pausing is optional.
		All conquests and grants of provinces to you are included in the mechanic.
		It will never distribute counties from your capital duchy, even if recently-acquired.
		Aside from also giving new random counts (1 per province) any baronies that you may have also conquered inside their new county (so that they may, in turn, grant the baronies to the appropriate types of characters-- maximizing opinion bonuses due to grants for all), the process always stops once you're no longer above your demesne limit.
		For every province being considered for auto-distribution, you will be explicitly prompted regarding the province first so that you may easily keep any choice provinces.
		TIP: Manually grant recently-acquired land to dynasty members or favorite vassals before taking the decision to neatly get rid of the rest.
	New CB: 'De Jure Duchy Claim.' Like 'De Jure County Claim' and 'De Jure Barony Claim' but at the duchy level. Usage:
		You must hold the de jure empire or kingdom of the duchy.
		If you're a King and not an Emperor, then you must also have passed either the Internal or Full King's Peace in your primary title.
		The defender must have at least two counties within the duchy (otherwise, 'De Jure County Claim' can be used).
		If it's possible to use this CB instead of multiple 'De Jure County Claim' wars in the same duchy, those 'De Jure County Claim' CBs will no longer be listed.
		In the CB list, these will simply be listed as 'De Jure Claim on <TITLE>', just as it is with 'De Jure County Claim,' so pay attention to the titles involved.
	New mechanic: Automatic Empire Disintegration.
		Any empire that either drops below a certain realm size or, in the case of Byzantium and the Latin Empire, loses control of Constantinople will now automatically be forfeit.
		If the emperor lacks any other empire or kingdom titles at time of forfeiture, EMF will search for an appropriate, de jure kingdom title (one which has no holder and passes the "51% rule" for provinces controlled within the kingdom) and grant it to the emperor. This prevents the Emperor from losing all his duke vassals when the empire title is destroyed.
		For empires unrelated to Constantinople, the realm size threshold for empire disintegration is <150 holdings on the SWMH map and <100 holdings on the vanilla map.
	All children are now inherently more liked by all characters (+15 opinion)-- except for direct vassals, should they be a child ruler
		Ergo, it is now more difficult for players in foreign courts to gather enough plot power to murder entire dynasties without a hitch.
	De jure barony claim CBs now have a truce length of only 2 years (rather than 10)
		No longer will clean-up of a few stray baronies take decades.
	Vast majority of CBs have been modified so that the AI prefers player targets to AI targets, all else being equal.
		If the AI has already determined a player is a valid and worthwhile target (i.e., thinks it might win) and must choose between the player and another equally terrifying, qualifying AI upon which to declare war, it will choose to declare war on the player. This is a rare situation.
		In practice, this will only make things significantly more difficult in the upcoming, optional Hardcore Mode, but the AI could still prove more aggressive against you than previously. Feel the Fear.
	50% increase in intrigue-scaled plot discovery chance when using spymaster's 'Scheme' job action
	Disabled redundant plot discovery via event for 'Scheme' job action and associated assassinations / thugs / mobs killing spymaster
	Councillors no longer lift fog-of-war due to multiplayer exploitation
	Personality trait restrictions removed from player for Become King ambition
	All crown laws now no longer have trait restrictions (succession type, vassal opinions, prestige, and other factors still matter)
	Great Goddess Isis now has sharper teeth
	(Lucky Rulers) Lucky liege levy law bonuses nerfed to 3/5 prior, vassal_opinion nerfed to 3/5 prior
	[SWMH] The de jure King of Ireland title now destroyed upon scenario startup, making all the Irish minors peers (de jure title still exists)
	FIX: Ambition to lower decadence disabled until Charlemagne
	FIX: (Lucky Rulers) Lucky trait inheritance now works while co-installed with VIET Events
	FIX: Ambition Fulfilled / Fulfilled Marriage Wish / Generous Relative opinions granted by councillor/other ambitions (vanilla bug)


EMF 1.01
	FIX: Imperial Reconquest CB no longer has 'Select valid Casus Belli' issue
	Religious Reconquest CB can now be used on Rum (or anyone that holds Rum) at all
	Holy War, Religious Reconquest, and Special Holy War CBs can now be used on a recently-formed Rum or Crusader State
	Imperial Reconquest CB no longer requires waiting 15 years after Rum forms or after scenario start if Rum is already formed at the scenario start
	Disabled vanilla "trait-shedding" events, which randomly remove a personality trait if you have more than 5 personality traits
	FIX: Pagan religions now correctly require only 30% religious authority to reform instead of 50% (consistent with nerf to controlled holy site bonuses)
	Holy War CB no longer requires any crown authority
	Muslim County Conquest CB, when a religious war, no longer requires any crown authority
	FIX: Muslim County Conquest CB, when a religious war, no longer enforces hidden trait restrictions upon the player
	AI ignores PB's "can't attack allied" restriction against player targets in all claim CBs, to be fair and to add succession crisis / dynastic feud mechanics back into the game
	AI ignores PB's trait restrictions in all CBs when attacking players, to be fair and more risky for the player
	AI ignores PB's de jure holy war restrictions when attacking players, to be fair and more risky for the player
	Reformed Norse may now use the Holy War and Religious Reconquest CBs across sea zones before the year 1100
	(PB/EMF) Tribal Invasion CB for non-Horde cultures now uses the same once-per-lifetime cooldown as the Pagan Subjugation CB (usage of the former will prevent the latter)


EMF 1.0
	Dynamic levies: For all rulers, liege levy-raising efficiency scales down with increasing realm size, the number of holdings in the ruler's (sub-)realm, on a very finely-grained nonlinear curve.
		This curve effectively balances large, decentralized realms; it relatively boosts smaller, more centralized realms; and yet it still ensures reliable and reasonable returns upon army size from conquest at every level.
		Players will note that total army sizes for large, decentralized realms are much smaller than they'd normally expect.
		Since all troop counts have been taken down a notch and the difference between larger and smaller realms (or vassals and lieges) significantly reduced, the world is alive with a much more dynamic AI when it comes to war.
		Players can see their current levy efficiency by scrolling down to the bottom of the Laws screen, where they will find a Levy Efficiency law, its associated percentage, and its effects in a tooltip.
		More information on the curve itself (which differs slightly between SWMH and vanilla maps) and its properties will be made public at a later date.
		NOTE: Currently, there might be a _cosmetic_ bug wherein it appears more than one dynlevy (dynamic levy) law is applied at once. In truth, only one of them is active, and it'll be automatically fixed when you change realm_size tiers (5-6 holdings/tier, so frequently). We've only seen this once, and it may have already been solved, but should players run into it, we've provided a debug event to cleanup the Laws view:
			Open up the console and invoke: event emf_dynlevy.24
	When a liege raises his liege levy, only half of the troops in a given vassal's subrealm are raised (vanilla-- in PB, it's 100%)
	PB-style demesne law sliders (Focus and Obligations) have been rewritten to provide different, easier to analyze effects that better complement the new liege levy system and make far more combinations realistically valid strategic choices.
		All vassal classes (castle, city, temple) contribute equal liege levy percentage changes for each law.  Ergo, liege levy army composition is far more balanced than previously.
		A player with a larger realm will find far more benefit than previously in increasing vassal obligations or, potentially, focusing upon levies rather than taxes, due to the countervailing effects of dynamic levies.
	Weather system that considers terrain, season, and other factors is constantly running in the background, serving its meteorologic might upon clusters of provinces throughout the world. If a province is so included in a regional anomaly, it will experience major effects upon levy sizes, taxes, local army movement speed, and more.
		Look for snazzy new weather-related province modifier icons when selecting a province on the map.
		Though effects are short-lived (seasonal), beware modifiers affecting movement speed during tactical campaigns, and take advantage of enemy levy size weaknesses.
	Smart Tactics System. Combat tactics have been completely overhauled for more realistic combat tactics, outcomes, cultural command differences, and overall balance.
		Tactics as a whole have been standardized to prevent certain compositions from excelling beyond the norm. For example, English Massive Longbow Volley is now only as powerful as the other cultural tactics.
		Every culture has a cultural tactic now, instead of just a few. These cultural tactics are designed to match their unique retinue or cultural building, so that those compositions will excel.
		No longer will having a few stray units of a different type cause their tactic to pop up. Now having a large group of a single unit will completely force out irrelevant tactics.
		Taking a page from Better Army's and ClearCombat's books, every tactic has Good/Neutral/Bad variations. Even a Bad tactic is better than no tactic, but better commanders will use better tactics and be more effective overall.
		By bringing the bonuses from particular tactics in line with those from technology, terrain, cultural differences, and leadership, the player gets more of what they expect from combat without dumbing-down any of the relevant factors.
	All mercenary companies' compositions completely rebalanced to synergize with the cultural tactics relevant to their origin and generally be more effective with regard to Smart Tactics.
	Independence Factions are now far more rowdy.
	2 new Muslim holy orders: 1 Shia (the Saqaliba), and 1 Sunni (the Arsiyah).
	Rebalanced holy order compositions and sizes to fit better in a dynamic levies world (fewer troops) and generally provide no implausible, runaway advantage to Christians, Muslims, or reformed pagans.
	Norse females may lead Norse troops (and serve as marshals). All hail Shield-Maiden Lagertha!
	Updated retinue model. Retinues cost more while reinforcing, and their reinforce rate is as slow as the levy reinforce rate. They have a smaller constant cost.
	Decentralized HRE and Themes System modifiers changed.
	Wars are more unpredictable, generally not decided by single battles, and take longer while allies are far more relevant.
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Lucky Rulers: Assigns a collection of rulers a special, inherited Lucky Ruler trait that ensures they will be interesting to watch and/or rival.
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Resurrected 'Random Rulers,' which applies a new set of random yet coherent traits (incl. all extended traits) to startup rulers and their families (credit to MFCamillus for finding the source of the crash in the old version and adding diplomat trait distribution).
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Vanilla Crusades: players may choose to use the vanilla Crusade mechanic (updated in CKII 2.0) rather than PB's different, custom mechanic.
	Until Charlemagne's promised overhaul of decadence, decadence's positive and negative effects have been completely removed.
		Decadence events, tribal invasions, faction effects, and Decadent trait distribution also disabled.
		Players can simply disregard whatever decadence value their dynasty has, although it should rarely change.
	[Ambition] Pledge Peace for 15 Years (can be repeated)
		Garners immediate vassal opinion and a defensive liege levy boost so long as the pledge is not broken.
		You will be punished if you break the pledge, although it's not particularly easy to accidentally do so (CBs, e.g., will be greyed-out).
		Significant bonuses upon completion.
	[Ambition] Win a War (can be repeated)
	[Ambition] Win a Holy War (can be repeated)
		For both of these ambitions, winning a defensive war also counts, all religious wars count for the latter-- not just Holy War, and all types of war count for the former.
	[Ambition] Find a Hobby
		Increases chances of gaining a lifestyle trait
	Tons of improvements to PB and/or vanilla to reduce event spam/incoherency/immersion-breaking while improving plausibility. Notable examples:
		Doubled the base MTTH for title and marriage begging events.
		Overhauled lifestyle events to be more varied and no longer have wildly differing MTTHs.
		Can no longer gain Craven in battle by totally random event. Likewise, gaining Brave is considerably more rare.
		Holy order recruitment now ignores married characters (unless they're without young children) and whether the holy order was "expelled" from the realm.
		Characters will no longer beg for titles while they're commanding troops during war.
		Characters captured via a siege will now defer any request for mercy for 1 year, after which a 50% longer MTTH applies to mercy requests.
	Tweaks to many vanilla traits for piety gain, lower vassal_opinion impacts, more advantages to previously "bad" traits like Content, etc.
	Republics have been notably de-nerfed-- as part of your realm, while watching them, and while playing as one.
	Chancellor can fabricate claims on duchies with lower diplomacy (as little as 12). Encourages less unlanding of original characters, although it is still unlikely.
	Fabrication of claims is now faster for these cases:
		Faster in capital duchy
		Faster if directly bordering _demesne_ province(s)
	Altered skill curve for councillors that also happens to support job efficacy gains at all skill levels up to and including 30.
	Free Investiture is now more attractive:
		It grants +8 opinion from vassals with bishops and +20 opinion from bishops to their direct lieges.
		Bishops now only inherently like the Pope with +15 opinion rather than +20.
	Royal marriage alliances ("Marriage Ties") yield +40 opinion rather than +30 opinion. Consider marrying your daughters to vassals.
	Lieges no longer inherently dislike faction members, and vassals may join 1 more faction than previously (everybody's in the Autonomy Faction).
	Combat trait advancement (with and without corresponding ambitions selected) is now much more likely from leading troops or winning duels.
	Combat trait advancement ambitions are now half as likely to be selected by the AI.
	Heresy spread should now be more gradual until a religion's authority truly plummets, at which point heresy takeover is more likely.
	Crusades/Jihads can be called with a 40% religious authority minimum, rather than 50%. Other changes to Crusade requirements to more closely follow vanilla.
	Catholic 'Request for Invasion' now more likely to be successful and requires only 40% religious authority, rather than 50%
	Catholic 'Ask for Claim' now more likely to be successful and costs only 50 piety instead of 100
	Serious piety boost for building new temples (i.e., granting them to a bishop), especially count-tier temples
	Minimum amount of de jure territory required to form or usurp an empire dropped to 2/3
	Secondary spouses are now significantly less fertile
	Marriage defines tweaked to deemphasize pro-blobbing unions at the risk of more strange unions (only axis of moddability)
	Takes advantage of the new static modifiers for age groups which were added in CKII 2.1 for modders and no longer uses the "old age" event.
		Ages 0-15:  health -0.5
		Ages 16-19: health +0.5, fertility +5%, sex_appeal_opinion +5, liege_opinion -10 (opinion of liege)
		Ages 20-29: health +0.5, fertility +10%, sex_appeal_opinion +5
		Ages 50-59: health -1.0, fertility -10%, sex_appeal_opinion -5
		Ages 60-99: health -2.0, fertility -15%, sex_appeal_opinion -10
	Councillors may be immediately reassigned.
	Players need only wait 1 year after activation to be able to cancel their ambition.
	De jure territory bonuses/penalties to levies have been significantly "flattened." Closer to a pre-CKII-2.0 setup than previously, it simplifies matters significantly with regard to dynamic levies, and promotes centralization (strong demesne, keeping vassals balkanized, etc.), as it applies to every ruler's capital:
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1.25
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_LEVY_MULT = 1.5
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_LEVY_MULT = 1.25
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.9
		CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.8
		OUTSIDE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		OUTSIDE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.7
	Countless tweaks to PB/vanilla defines and modifiers, significantly changing gameplay behavior.
	An excess of changes that were made to both PB and EMF over the last couple months that need not be duplicated in this log.
