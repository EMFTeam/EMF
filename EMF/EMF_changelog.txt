0.9.0 [ALPHA]
- Added vanilla and PB on_actions, registered dynlevy title transfer events to listen to new on_actions
- [DynamicLevies] Adjusted parameters of curve to cover the realm_size range (15,330) with nonlinear levy law modifier [1,0.5]
- Added version.txt for installer
- Startup flavor series removed due to deterministic random seed at scenario start
- Demesne focus made more flexible and law modifier equations improved, Iqta enjoys better tax conversion efficiency, laws rebalanced
- Demesne focus/obligations law sliders now auto-generated, focus slider equation needs more work
- [DynamicLevies] Initial implementation (sans revolt levy efficiency handling) ready to test
- [DynamicLevies] Completed proper scaling curve, adjusted parameters, current levy efficiency % should display in Laws now
- [DynamicLevies] Add scenario initialization evt for subsystem
- [DynamicLevies] Added complete codegen output for dynlevy law setting event
- Added a crappy generic placeholder trait icon and the definition of the liberal and conservative traits
- Inherited PB's crown laws. PB succession laws will, pragmatically speaking, not be inherited by the EMF base. Demesne laws are fully overridden.
- Started drafting EMF's tweaked defines.lua. Base template was from PB. Assume PB overrides of vanilla are
  inherited, and otherwise note all of the following points of divergence, file-ordered (remainder of file to go):
	CALL_TO_WAR_DELAY = 48 (4 years, from 5) [Encourage higher alliance participation]

	CHANGE_AMBITION_YEARS = 1 (-1 from PB, -2 from vanilla) [More active ambition selection involvement]
	ASSIGN_ACTION_DAYS = 0 (60 in PB, 183 in vanilla) [Various reasons]
	MAX_GENERATED_TRAITS_FOR_HISTORICAL = 5 (+1) [More variance, more aligned w/ actual accumulated adult trait counts]
	LUNATIC_TRAIT_CHANCE_FACTOR = 0.4 (+100%) [From inbreeding: far, far too rare at default]
	LUNATIC_DIVINE_BLOOD_TRAIT_CHANCE_FACTOR = 0.4 [Consistency w/ above]
	MAX_REPUBLIC_COUNTIES_IN_REALM = 0.2 (+100%) [Encourage slightly more freedom in diversity of government types, patch 2.0 default was too low]
	EMPIRE_DEJURE_COUNTY_LIMIT_TO_CREATE = 0.667 (2/3 rule, -11% from PB, -16.5% from vanilla)

	TRADE_POST_OPINION_EFFECT = 0.5 (-33% from PB, +25% from vanilla) [More readily allow cross-[religion|culture]_group trade, previously barred]
	DOGE_SUCC_RANDOM_FACTOR = 500 (return to vanilla)
	OVER_MAX_DEMESNE_TAX_PENALTY = 0.20 (return to vanilla)
	LOOT_EVERY_X_DAYS = 4 (+2, return to vanilla) [Discourages Norse exploit where looting succeeds before levies can ever be raised against them]
	LOOT_IDEAL_MIN_TROOPS = 500 (-500, return to vanilla) [Makes non-Norse raiding more useful]
	REALM_SIZE_MULTIPLIER = 0.005 (+25%, return to vanilla) [Decadence is too low in PB for large realms]
	LEVY_MAINTENANCE_FACTOR = 1.75 (-12.5% from PB, +16.67% from vanilla) [More fair levy vs. mercenary maint. ratio than PB, relatively favors AI, allows wars to be longer]
	OPINION_WHEN_NO_LEADER = 0 (return to vanilla) [Exploitation of -100 has apparently broken since that change: liege levy subunits never contain commanders; experiment w/ default]
	BATTLE_WARSCORE_WORTH = 100 (-25 from PB, +25 from vanilla) [War is longer, more difficult, more costly, allies have time to arrive, and multiple battles + sieging is nec.]
	BATTLE_WARSCORE_DEFENDER_MULTIPLIER = 1.6 (+14% from PB, +7% from vanilla) [Favor defensive wins, favors AI: defender does not have advantage of having prepared]
	MIN_LEVY_RAISE_OPINION_THRESHOLD = -100 (-50 from PB, -100 from vanilla) [Allow full range of opinion to affect liege levy, simpler liege levy calculation, favors AI]

	BATTLE_TECH_MULTIPLIER = 0.5 (+50%, return to vanilla) [Tech self-regulates with non-linear, continously scaled ahead penalty, higher mil. tradition => higher mil. tech avg]

	CAPITAL_WARSCORE_MULTIPLIER = 1.5 (+25% from PB, +50% from vanilla) [Emphasize the strategic value of the capital; helps with lowered battle warscore mult. for small wars]

	COASTAL_SUPPLY_BONUS = 0.5 (return to vanilla)
	ARMY_LOAD_MOVE_COST = 30.0 (+50%) [Much slower to load into a galley for departure than to jump out of it and exploitatively raid coastal provinces]

	OVERRUN_RATIO = 21 (+40% from PB, -16% from vanilla) [More battles will be required to decisively defeat an army]
	LEADER_MARTIAL_DAMAGE_BONUS = 0.05 (-37.5% from PB, return to vanilla) [If set too high, heavily favors the player & can make for unrealistically bloody battles]
	WAR_CONTRIBUTION_OCCUPATION_PER_DAY = 15 (+50%) [Occupation is underrated, consistent with PB's elevated battle contribution factor]

	RETINUE_INCREASE_PER_TECH = 1.0 (+50% from PB, -50% from vanilla) [Need to encourage late-game retinues as a strategy for keeping feudal vassals in check]
	[Retinue AI pays attention to hire and reinforce cost while assuming constant cost is free. Citizen soldiers cost to recruit, train, and equip, but they live free off wherever cities. Ergo, their plausible cost model follows:]
	RETINUE_HIRE_COST_MULTIPLIER = 0.08 (+300% from PB, return to vanilla)
	RETINUE_REINFORCE_COST = 1.65 (-17.5% from PB, +17.9% from vanilla)
	RETINUE_CONSTANT_COST = 0.03 (-0.37 from PB, +INF% from vanilla)
		[Overhead while soldiers are free to do as they please and are living off the cities in which they're presently located are 1/50th of active reinforcement cost: recruiting, training, possibly mounting (teehee), and equipping]
	[Full set of levy / liege levy size multipliers provided for reference. Totally experimental: primary goal is to deemphasize patch 2.0's de jure liege levy maluses and simplify behavior, as that should complement realm_size-scaled liege levies much better.  Indeed, realm_size-scaled liege levies make de jure tier liege levy factor confusing, obsolete, and arbitrary.  The capital duchy/county bonuses are important for centralization strategy encouragement, though. These semantics enforce all balance and centralization strategy goals, AFAIK.]
	 LIEGE_LEVY_SIZE_MULTIPLIER = 0.5 (-50%, return to vanilla) [50% of troops stay in vassal subrealm, no magic troops, consistent with UI]

- FIX: Logic error regarding flag duration in 90-day pulse
- FIX: Added missing decisions = {} for isis quarterly maintenance pulse decision
- Added isis quarterly maintenance pulse for weather events (and whatever else)
	Implemented in style of high-priority AI decision: quite accurate timing, such accuracy
	or precise seasonality may not prove necessary for the weather events.
- [SmartTactics] Adjusted unit maintenance to vanilla levels, except for Archers
- [SmartTactics] Nerfed Pikemen skirmish defense
- [SmartTactics] Added first draft of smart tactics system - a unit that has 30% of a given troop will use tactics that benefit that troop
