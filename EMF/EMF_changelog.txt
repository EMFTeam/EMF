EMF 5.03 [RC2]
	*MAJOR:*
		No Ahistorical Empires (new default de jure setup):
			By default, EMF now starts with only historically de jure empires on the map (Holy Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, and Persian Empire)
			New scenario customization decision: *Add Ahistorical Empires*
				Enables the map's usual ahistorical de jure empires. This customization is reversible with the classic *Remove Ahistorical Empires* scenario customization decision, which appears after enacting the former decision (and vice versa).
				NOTE: The custom kingdom/empire formation decisions are always available to players regardless of the choice to add/remove ahistorical de jure empire, and such custom kingdoms/empires are always disabled for the AI regardless of this setting as well.
			With the default setup, the map's usual ahistorical de jure empires are only rendered titular and NOT deactivated
				Player & AI multi-kings alike can still create the *titular* empires if they control the empire title's de jure capital and meet the minimum requirements for empire title creation (e.g., total realm size) in addition to any other title-specific requirements (usually related to control of specific titles and culture/religion)
				If you want to fully deactivate them, first use the new customization decision *Add Ahistorical Empires* followed by the traditional *Remove Ahistorical Empires* to make it final
		*Feudal Elective Succession* UNLOCKED: it's now always an alternative, additional succession law option for *player* Muslims and Indians
		Decadence Removal:
			Decadence has been removed from the game. It is a flawed concept which requires a complete overhaul before it will return.
				The notion that all Muslims of common patrilineal descent suffer a curse/blessing for the "sins" of their dynasty members, no matter how distant or unrelated-- and that these dynasty-wide effects include armies' morale, vassal limit, demesne income, chance of random invasion from implausible sources, etc. -- is all stunningly fictional.
				NOTE: It is probable that EMF will adopt some form of Rylock's work on decadence replacement in CK2Plus in the future. In short, his approach also completely removes the hard-coded decadence mechanic, but it replaces it with a soft-coded mechanic which is limited to dynasty members in the same top realm, among other improvements.
			Iqta & Tribal government types no longer use decadence at all
			Decadence events/decisions/ambitions/invasions/defines have been disabled (i.e., the things which serve no other purpose but to affect/reflect decadence)
		Viceroyalty Removal:
			Due to myriad bugs and gameplay-suboptimal restrictions with the Charlemagne DLC's implementation of viceroyalties, they've been removed. Instead, enacting/having *Imperial Administration* law gives the emperor free duchy revocation (regardless of empire).
			While we-- and apparently most of you-- think this change is already a major net positive for imperial gameplay for vassals and emperors alike, **note that we do plan to add a new imperial government form and a viceroy-replacement system in a future release.**
		Restoration of Byzantium:
			Whether it be due to AED (Automatic Empire Disintegration) or plain old history (1204-1261), the Byzantine Empire (ERE) title is often enough destroyed due to loss of Constantinople. In the past, this has often resulted in an irreparable situation for the Empire, especially for the AI. Instead, we'd like to more correctly model the 'Imperial Anarchy' that such a loss would imply, so we've added:
				New decision *Restore Byzantium* will appear for those whom control the Queen of Cities, Constantinople, during such a period of imperial anarchy.
					Its requirements are best explained by its in-game tooltip, but suffice it to say, they're quite flexible but also no gimme; one must indeed re-establish imperial authority before enactment.
					Upon enactment of the decision:
						The ERE title will be restored along with, at the least, its traditional laws: *Medium Crown Authority*, *Primogeniture Succession*, *Free Infidel Revocation*, *Imperial Administration*, and so on.
						Any held, titular empires and kingdoms as well as held, de jure vassal kingdoms of the Empire will be destroyed without penalty.
						Vassalize the Varangian Guard, if they've been formed.
						Vassalize your religious head and grant him Hagia Sophia.
				Two new, tiered 'Imperial Invasion' CBs added to model the 'Imperial Anarchy':
					A CB to invade Thrace and, most importantly, make Constantinople your new capital. While the AI will avoid 'long shots,' this CB doesn't have bordering requirements, is available to any independent ruler that meets the basic requirements of the *Restore Byzantium* decision (religious branch, culture group, etc.), and may even be used against those whom also meet those same requirements. Until the Empire is restored or fades from memory, the de jure Imperial capital will be under constant threat of invasion from Byzantine warlords vying to be the successors to the Empire.
					A CB available only to the currently-legitimate holder of Constantinople which allows invasion of any of the duchies in the de jure capital kingdom of the Empire, and once its counties are all under heel, optionally allows further invasions of any neighboring duchies in Achaea/Morea (SWMH) or Nikaea.
					Note that Papists such as the historical Latin Emperors are not considered "legitimate" by these CBs (or the restoration decision), although a direct path for the titular Latin Empire to become the de jure [Eastern] Roman Empire does now exist if the Latin Emperor should no longer follow the Catholic Pope and practice acceptable Roman customs.
					Both CBs, upon success, will subjugate lords of your specific religion *and will purge the rest*.
		*Protected Council Appointments:*
			This new law offers a permanent opinion boost of +10 from all powerful vassals that are members of the ruling council, current and future, so long as their job security is indeed protected (in addition to a temporary bonus from enactment).
			What's the catch? So long as a councilmember remains "powerful" (as indicated by the in-game "fist" icon), you cannot fire them from their council position -- or you must revoke the law.
			The HRE starts with this law by default.
		Castle cultural building selections now uniformly depend upon their province's culture; the previous, relatively complicated and unrealistic criteria based upon *owner* culture has been removed
	*CHANGES:*
		It is no longer possible for a liege to coerce a vassal to leave their chosen 4-interest faction (i.e., Court, Prosperity, Glory, or Tradition) via the standard spymaster job; however, a liege may still coerce vassals out of the standard, conspiratorial factions as usual
		The *Theme System* laws for the Byzantine Empire (ERE), a legacy of Project Balance, have been removed
		Reduced the base probability of a battlefield duel by -30%
		*Late Feudal Administration* law (permanently unlocks advanced succession laws) is now more strict regarding required Legalism technology vs. *Crown Authority*. Essentially, the technology requirements have all been increased by one level, with CA-independent unlock at level 6 while still being possible to unlock at as low as level 3 (see in-game tooltip for breakdown of Legalism tech vs. currently-effective CA).
		In the past, it was possible to bypass *Crown Authority* or *Administration* law requirements when enacting advanced succession laws if no crown law title affected your succession law title. With the advent of *Late Feudal Administration*, this loophole is no longer allowed for Primogeniture/Ultimogeniture, but it is still allowed for Seniority.
		Obligations law sliders now all have unique graphics for each of the 4 vassal classes instead of text; Focus law sliders were already graphical
		Threat / Defensive Pacts:
			Defensive pacts cannot form against a ruler unless their threat level is at least 15% (threshold increased from 5%)
			Reduced different-religion-group defensive pact distance cut-off to 300, which is the same value used for same-religion-group defensive pacts
			The *maximum* amount of threat increase per province conquered in a war is now 4% instead of 8% (vanilla's reference cap is 15%/province)
			Threat loss from granting independence to non-de-jure vassals reduced by -90%
			Threat gained through inheritance reduced by -67%
			Threat will be no longer be gained due to vassals
			AI, when evaluating whether to join/leave a defensive pact, is now less sensitive to distance from the threat than in the previous version of EMF but still significantly more sensitive than vanilla (i.e., they are less likely to take part in d-pacts against distant threats, *ceteris paribus*)
		De jure assimilation of duchies into kingdoms (de jure drift) now requires 75 years of de facto duchy control (instead of 100 years); for reference, recall that in EMF 5.02, the time requirement for de jure assimilation of kingdoms into empires was dropped to 50 years (instead of 100 as well) -- kingdoms drift faster than duchies
		Monthly prestige gain from held count- or higher-tier titles has been halved across the board; monthly prestige gain from vassals, weighted by vassal-tier, has NOT changed, however.
		Prestige gain from creating titles has also been nerfed:
			Duke-tier titles earn you 125 prestige (vs. vanilla 200)
			King-tier titles earn you 250 prestige (vs. vanilla 400)
			Empire-tier titles earn you 500 prestige (vs. vanilla 800, previously 1200 in EMF)
		Prestige costs of destroying titles have likewise been updated to equal the new, lower prestige gains from title creation
		Castle cultural buildings, cultural retinues, and combat tactics:
			Added new cultural buildings, retinues, and adjusted tactics for Castilians, Leonese, and Aragonese cultures (emphasis on heavy cavalry and infantry)
			Made the 'Shock Charge' tactic available to Occitans to put them on par with their French overlords
			Granted the Old Saxons the appropriate cultural tactic for their cultural building/levy composition
			Readjusted Romanian, Russian, and Lithuanian retinues to better complement their army compositions
			Added new retinues for Bosnian, Carinthian, Galician, Cornish, Anglo-Norse, Norse-Gaelic, and Old Saxon cultures
			Adjusted Arab cultural building to restore maintenance values to a reasonable level
			Added North African cultural building & retinues which are more coherent with their Berber cultural tactics
			Adjusted Dutch/Frisian/Low Frankish cultural building and retinues in order to promote synergy with their cultural tactics
			Adjusted Lombard cultural building and retinue to be more aligned with cultural tactic and historical legacy
			Adjusted Albanian retinue for better cultural tactic coherency
		Councillors may no longer be reassigned instantly and require a cooldown of 3 months before redeployment
			Bonus consequence: placing a councillor now lifts the "fog of war" at their location again, as it does in vanilla (with no cooldown, this would've been an exploit).
		(Vanilla Map) Duchy of Aragon de jure moved to Kingdom of Aragon in 1066 and later start dates
		(EMF+SWMH) Christian Iberian kingdom dynamic de jure expansion: Duchy of Badajoz is now a potential de jure expansion target for Portugal (3rd in priority after Leon and Castille, respectively)
	*MINOR CHANGES:*
		*Council Authority* law has been removed due to serving no practical purpose after other additions & changes in this version
		If using any of the age customization traits in the Ruler Designer, those traits will be immediately removed upon campaign initialization rather than requiring up to an in-game month before removal
		Loot per nomadic population (i.e., when raiding nomadic provinces) has been doubled
		Rulers now have up to 2 months to influence undecided council members' votes after proposing a law change (up from 1 month)
		The 'crowded court' threshold for increasing disease spread chance has been raised by +50% to 60
		The randomized reward event for completing the 'Convert a Province' [religion] ambition is now hidden; the reward will nevertheless apply
		AED (Automatic Empire Disintegration), when trying to select an appropriate kingdom title to which a rump empire should be demoted, now uses the "51% rule" for de jure county control (i.e., more than half) rather than the 50% rule normally used for kingdom title creation
		Mortals may no longer plot to kill the All-Seeing Isis!
		*Convert to Merchant Republic*, the day-1 scenario customization "diplo-action," is no longer an option for rulers of landless tiles -- no Popes, no mercenaries, no holy orders ... and no Isis!
	*MAJOR FIXES:*
		Creating or usurping titles as the Byzantine Empire (ERE) will no longer cause mysterious net prestige deductions
		Various rare but potentially serious issues caused by the succession law overhaul of EMF 5.02 have been addressed with *yet another succession law overhaul*. We've eliminated the possibility of such issues due to using a more "vanilla-friendly" design to achieve the very same goals (with the very minor exception noted below).
			Due to limitations of CK2's succession law system: when enacting a succession law change, it is now possible to spend more prestige than you actually have, which could result in negative prestige. Though this is unlikely to occur when otherwise meeting the requirements for succession law changes, pay mind to the prestige costs of succession law changes in order to avoid negative prestige.
		AED (Automatic Empire Disintegration) will no longer pick fallback kingdom titles which are actually inactive or titular (very rare but major & stupid)
		Fixed the *De Jure Holding War* CB not being available in some cases that it should (and not usurping intended baronies) as well as an issue with the *3rd-Party De Jure County Claim* CB
	*FIXES:*
		4-interest faction demands for their liege to surrender a county title are now WAD
		*Primogeniture Succession* no longer appears as a [disabled] succession law option for Muslims
		(EMF+SWMH) Christian Iberian kingdom dynamic de jure expansion: Duchy of Beja now only requires complete *county* control to qualify for dynamic drift (i.e., not necessarily complete subholding control), like the other duchies covered by this system
		Corrected some incorrect culture references in 00_combat_tactics.txt
		Removed extra Frisian castle cultural building
		Vanilla fix for missing localisation in the "tournament is over" event
		Fixes for some grammar localisation (incorrect pronouns) in a few of the old Project Balance ambitions
		Succession law factions no longer require their associated laws' additional "allow" conditions to form-- only their "potential" (i.e., such factions now ignore *Crown Authority* or *Administration* laws-- only pragmatically affects Primogeniture and Seniority factions)
		(EMF+SWMH) Fixed a minor issue with Frisian provinces converting to Dutch when they should not (e.g., before Dutch culture has even emerged from Frankisk / Low Frankish culture)


EMF 5.02 [2016-03-04]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		Compatible with CKII v2.5.2
			As warned, 2.5.2 added new vanilla personality traits, and this renders old, pre-2.5.2 savegames trait-incompatible (all character traits will be shifted/shuffled in the new version-- NOT recommended)
			See patch 2.5.2's changelog for incorporated changes
		Refactored and expanded law group: *Administration*
			*Early Feudal Administration:* Default equivalent to old *Feudal Administration* but available at all tiers
			*Late Feudal Administration:* Unlocks all advanced succession laws (Primogeniture, Seniority, and Ultimogeniture) independently of Crown Authority
				Its requirements are largely based upon Legalism technology level and the level of *Crown Authority*, if any, affecting the title *at the time of its passing*:
					Legalism tech level 5 unlocks it regardless of CA.
					Legalism tech level 4 unlocks it if affected by at least *Limited Crown Authority*.
					Legalism tech level 3 unlocks it if affected by at least *Medium Crown Authority*.
				Majesty tech level 3 is required.
				Must be duke-tier or higher unless your liege has already enacted the law, in which case there is also no prestige cost for passing it.
				Duke-tier, king-tier, and emperor-tier require prestige costs of 500/750/1000, respectively, to pass the law.
				NOTE: *Medium Crown Authority* and *High Crown Authority* still independently unlock Seniority and Primogeniture/Ultimogeniture, respectively.
			*Imperial Administration:* Equivalent to same-named law of the past, but it now also requires a prestige cost of 1000 to enact
		All non-gender succession laws have been completely overhauled under the hood for greater flexibility regarding manual succession law changes (changing the law intentionally as opposed to by faction demand)
			Succession law changes have a prestige requirement and *cost* that scales with the title's tier (barony/county/duchy/kingdom/empire costs 125/250/500/750/1000 prestige, respectively).
			Succession law change reactions are now far more intelligent, with events to handle disinheritance or being displaced from the line of succession and much more.
			This has required a major overhaul; if you notice any strange behavior relating to succession laws, please report it.
	*CHANGES:*
		Added prestige costs (and requirements) for raising *Tribal Organization* law
		Added prestige costs for raising *Crown Authority* law; the cost is half the required amount, and the requirements haven't changed
		Non-aggression pacts between vassal and liege no longer prevent those vassals from joining factions
			Now that this is moddable, AI vassals will no longer dissolve their NAPs with their liege if their liege opinion is negative
		The *De Jure Holding War* CB can no longer be used to take holdings from vassalized holy orders when it wouldn't be available if the holy order were independent. The decisions to expel the holy orders are still available, for the player.
		In multiplayer, only the game host will be able to use or see the scenario customization decisions
			For *non-hosts in multiplayer*, other decisions that normally would've been hidden until unpausing are now shown beforehand, as in vanilla (again, only relevant to MP).
		(EMF+SWMH) The English Melting Pot now also assimilates Anglo-Norse and Danish province and character cultures within the English region
		(EMF+SWMH) The Formation of Rum event now also transfers the duchy of Tayk from the ERE to Rum
		The minimum liege levy provided at -50 opinion is now 0% rather than 25% (below -50 opinion, vassals will still not provide any troops); at +100 opinion it is, of course, still 100%
		Slightly less prestige will be gained from battles
		Shattered retreat:
			Movement speed reduced to +30% from +50%
			Maximum chosen path length for retreat capped at 7 provinces on SWMH (-30%) and 6 provinces on the vanilla map (-40%)
		Threat and Defensive Pacts:
			Compared to vanilla, it is less likely for distant AIs to join/stay in a defensive pact, and the current size of a realm is less of a factor whenever increasing Threat level.
			EMF+SWMH behavior also assumes natural realm sizes (number of holdings in the realm) are about twice as large, and the equations for Threat gain and loss reflect that assumption.
		In 4i (4-interest) faction revolts, succession law faction revolts, and faction revolts to lower *Crown Authority*, only rebels that are allowed to inherit feudal titles may usurp liege titles upon rebel success (no prince-bishops, no bishop nominees, no horses, etc.)
	*FIXES:*
		Due to strange behavior in *multiplayer*, battlefield duels have been disabled in multiplayer games (thanks to @Lord of Pain for the report)
		The ambitions to become a councillor (of which there are 5) now properly abort if the character becomes independent


EMF 5.01 [2016-02-16]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		The *Restore the Papacy in Rome* decision is now multifarious
			If the top liege (i.e., ruler taking the decision) has setup an Antipope:
				AND the "de jure" Pope is unlanded, the Antipapal claim will be pressed and Rome given to the new "de jure" Pope.
				AND the "de jure" Pope is NOT unlanded, the decision cannot be used.
			If the top liege doesn't follow an Antipope, Rome will be given to the "de jure" Pope, as per the usual purpose of this decision.
			The new Antipapal logic works for both Catholic (Papal State) and Fraticelli (Fraticelli Papacy) Popes.
		The *Gender Equality* scenario customization decision now sets the *Full Status of Women* law on appropriate titles when "Full Gender Equality" (i.e., the option which includes laws) is chosen
			The newest positive effect of this behavior: Female rulers or rulers with female heirs will no longer suffer any opinion penalties from vassals
	*CHANGES:*
		De jure claim CBs for the county of Rome or duchy of Latium are no longer valid if the defender is the attacker's religious head
		The minimum levy and maximum levy bonuses associated with *Crown Authority* have been toned-down a bit
		*King's Peace* crown laws have been added back into the game for those without the Conclave DLC
		*Title Revocation* law setup has changed:
			If you own Conclave, *Title Revocation* is a demesne law: *Title Revocation Allowed* requires your primary title to either be unaffected by any crown law title or for that crown law title to have at least *Limited Crown Authority*, while *Free Infidel Title Revocation* can only be passed if your primary title is subject to at least *Medium Crown Authority*.
			If you do not own Conclave, *Title Revocation* will once again work as it did prior to Conclave's release (as a crown law).
			Tribals, like nomads, no longer receive a special *Title Revocation* law, as *Tribal Organization* has now been modified to encapsulate that fully.
		The "Become Councillor" ambitions are no longer available for advisers (voters already on the council without a specific council position)
	*FIXES:*
		All council appointment criteria should now be WAD (a bug in EMF 5.0 was leading to, most noticeably, women being allowed as court chaplains!)
		4i (4-interest) factions will no longer inappropriately decide to revolt when their liege's liege has enforced Realm Peace, a situation which would make the revolt war itself impossible
		The Fraticelli Papacy now uses the College of Cardinals (Papal Succession), a vanilla bug/oversight that somehow escaped us for far too long!
		A few minor localisation fixes & improvements (better tooltips)


EMF 5.0 [2016-02-14]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		Compatibility patch for Conclave / CKII v2.5.1
		Conclave-related / differences from vanilla:
			Until patch 2.5.2 is stable with the promised "better infamy," infamy has been nerfed to the point of essentially only serving as a [weak] CB cooldown.
			Units undergoing a shattered retreat only regain morale at the normal rate and not at an accelerated rate; they also have a shorter possible range of provinces to which they're allowed to retreat.
			Members of any of the 4i (4-interest) factions simply want a member of their faction that is a voter on their liege's council; it no longer matters which position per faction.
			Council members may always join the 4i (4-interest) factions regardless of whether the council is content; this exception to the rule doesn't apply to other types of factions.
			EMF's unique *Crown Authority* law and sub-law system has been retained-- as have vassal obligations and every other law but Status of Women, which is locked to the DLC (old rules for gender-related stuff apply when Conclave isn't active)
			Some of vanilla's new ambitions have been retooled, as they weren't very well-implemented at time of release
			Council members that are members of 4i (4-interest) factions will vote upon laws and interactions [partially] according to the interests of their faction
		The Duel Engine is back, and it's better than ever. Let the epic drama on the battlefield (and some other places) flow through you! [Our old version/fork was replaced with CK2Plus's much newer version. Many thanks to our Plus compatriots and the maintainer of the New Duel Engine, @jordarkelf.]
		(EMF+SWMH) The titular stem-duchy titles present in the HRE in most start dates (Swabia, Lower Lorraine, Bavaria, Saxony, and Franconia) will now be destroyed if their holder gains the corresponding de jure, king-tier stem-duchy title.
		A same-religion *County Conquest* CB has been given to all unreformed pagans. It works very similarly to the same-religion-group version of Muslims' *County Conquest* CB, but it costs 200 prestige instead of 50 piety to use.
	*CHANGES:*
		The alt-history Frankish/Western HRE which can be formed from the TOG bookmark now has its own dedicated title, `e_hre_french`, rather than reusing the existing `e_france` title
		The AI can no longer use its own version of the [now deactivated] *Raise Tribal Army* decision


EMF 4.05 [2016-01-24]
	*NEW FEATURES:*
		Upon reaching adulthood (age 16), male characters with mothers that have strong claims upon titles will "pre-inherit" them as weak claims (does not apply to claims on titles governed by Absolute Cognatic succession law)
		Newborn infants now have a 3% chance of dying during childbirth (stillborn or otherwise)
		For a temporary period following a succession, rulers will be able to raise fewer liege levies than otherwise
		The HRE will have less trouble with Independence factions forming in Italy and especially Burgundy despite not being their de jure liege
		(EMF+SWMH) Bookmarks after 1205 restored, as these later start dates are increasingly presentable in terms of coherent title history (some areas still need love in late-era, though)
		To view interest faction mood and membership at a glance, simply view a character in such a faction, and their associated interest faction's icon will display on a color scale of gold (Happy) to red (Angry) in the view's character modifier section
	*CHANGES:*
		The 4i (4 interests) factions (Court, Prosperity, Glory, and Tradition) are now *significantly* more difficult to keep happy all the time due to rebalancing of the aggregrate vassal opinion scale which determines faction mood
			Note that the new scale should be more intuitive for EMF players when considering the various relevant thresholds of opinion already in EMF; the previous scale was calibrated according to CK2Plus's balance, which didn't fit EMF goals very well.
		Base fertility has been reduced further overall
		Magyar event troops will disband upon their initial ruler's death
		Muslims should now be more on par with Christian strength:
			Inter-Muslim wars cost less piety per month
			Muslims gain twice as much piety per month for each mosque in their demesne
			Boost in secondary spouse fertility (still much less than primary spouse fertility)
			Muslims are no longer penalized w/ -10% tax from Muslim provinces (vs. non-Muslim, which receive a +25% bonus)
			Decadence's impact (either positive or negative) upon demesne income has been halved (now +10% to -10% for decadence of 0-100)
			Decadence's impact upon army morale is now never negative, but it can still be positive for low decadence
			Decadence gain from unlanded dynasty members has been dramatically reduced
		Vassal opinion of you due to raising their liege levies for extended periods of time now stacks-up much faster (-1 opinion per 42 days vs. the vanilla 61 days)
		Characters will now considerably more rarely live well into their 70s
		Lovers or concubines (that aren't married to each other) will experience more pregnancies than previously, ceteris paribus
		De jure kingdom titles will now be assimilated by empire titles (de jure drift) in 50 years rather than 100 (NOTE: kingdoms still assimilate de jure duchies after the standard 100 years)
		The College of Cardinals' cardinal & pope selection/scoring mechanism now barely at all factors dynasty prestige of the candidate into the equation (truly should no longer see many Karling/Jimena/etc. popes in mid-to-late stage of a campaign)
		The personal piety of a religious head no longer plays any role at all in their religion's Religious Authority
		Catholic bishops now pay a larger portion of their tax to the Pope if they prefer him over their liege (not as much as pre-2.4, however)
		Patricians now pay only 25% of regular city tax to their liege (halved from vanilla)
		Nomads will now enjoy higher max. population / empty holding slots (moreso on EMF+SWMH)
		Nomads have a clan limit of 12 instead of 9 when playing EMF without SWMH (with it, it was already capped at 12)
		Levies are now more expensive to maintain while raised
		Liege levies now replenish more slowly (as slowly as retinues reinforce in EMF-- 3%/month), but demesne levies continue to replenish faster (4%/month)
		The threshold at which a court is considered "crowded" for the purposes of accelerated disease incidence and spread has been lowered from a court size of 50 to 40
		AI raid aggression has been reduced
		AI willingness to declare war at any given time is now TWICE as much as vanilla (and 67% more likely than prior in EMF)
	*FIXES:*
		De jure expansion of Aragon during the Reconquista now correctly triggers in 2 possible cases that were previously not likely to trigger due to a logic error and in another case which was fully-impossible to trigger (Mallorca)
		Fixed the tooltip for the de jure expansion of Christian Iberia events
		Succession law faction revolts will no longer invalidate for succession types other than Seniority whenever the original war liege (defender) is replaced (e.g., due to death or title usurpation)
		Succession law faction revolts for laws aside from Seniority will now correctly enforce the change in succession law upon rebel success
		Succession law faction ultimatums, if accepted by the liege, now properly change the correct law when the law in question is not Seniority (in which case it already worked properly)
		Fixed a few edge cases not previously handled in the new dynamic civil war system which would otherwise cause incoherent game state (very rare)
		When a vote of no confidence in a 4i (4 interests) faction leader is taken, the faction leader will now correctly vote against the motion rather than for it
		Fixed loophole wherein players could join multiple interest factions at once (though the AI could not)


EMF 4.04 [2015-12-23]
	Due to collaboration with the CK2Plus team (Rylock in particular), EMF now features the jointly-overhauled "interest faction" system from Plus as well as extended civil war mechanics. The system has so many moving parts that an oversimplified summary of the system will have to do for this changelog (pay attention to tooltips for faction mood effects of some your actions or achievements as well as opinion-breakdown tooltips for faction members).
		The new factions (of which virtually every vassal is a member of exactly one):
			Court -- cares most about autonomy and recognition
			Prosperity -- cares most about wealth, order, and sustained peace
			Glory -- cares most about prestige-- their own, their liege's, their realm's-- and are pro-war
			Tradition -- cares about piety & faith, resists change, hates heresy, and prefers the tried-and-true
		Civil wars due to the 4 interest factions (which may have been sparked due to failure to comply with a myriad of possible demands) as well as the generalized Lower Crown Authority Faction and succession law factions now use a much more dangerous, high-stakes CB and feature dynamic call-to-arms as well as post-war rewards/penalties for loyalists/neutrals/rebels and other such tasty Christmas treats.
			If you lose one of these civil wars against rebels:
				Any specific demands related to the civil war will be enforced (e.g., reverting the succession law on your primary title after a change)
				Crown Authority will be lowered on all of your crown titles (if applicable).
				Tribal Organization will be lowered (if applicable).
				All of your counties that are de jure vassal titles to any of the rebels will be surrendered to their de jure liege. Counties that rebels have claims upon will be surrendered as well.
				All of your vassals that are de jure vassals of any of the rebels will be transferred under the rebel with the most specific (lowest-tier) de jure liege title.
				If you are the original civil war defender (i.e., you didn't ascend the throne in the middle of such a civil war), your primary-tier and primary titles may be usurped by rebels with claims on them, that are pretenders to them, or that are heirs to them. **Failing that, you will be forced to abdicate.**
			If you are victorious over such a civil war:
				All of the rebels will be thrown into prison, and what happens to them afterward is entirely up to you.
	(EMF+SWMH) Automatic de jure expansion of the Christian Iberian kingdoms (i.e., Portugal, Leon, Castille, and Aragon) has been completely rewritten to be much more fair, lead to a more realistic Reconquista, less railroaded / more flexible in total possibilities for which duchies drift into which kingdoms, and very robust
	If the Byzantines regain de jure Rum, Rum will become titular, with the territory reverting to de jure Anatolia / Konya under the de jure Byzantine Empire
	Galicia, when titular, is now deactivated and destroyed after acquiring a de jure king- or empire-tier title
	The "legal marriage age" and the age at which young adult portraits are shown has been reduced to 14. The age of adulthood (i.e., when the kids may become rulers without a regent) is still 16.
	Some significant "natural selection" maluses have been added to the "dwarf" trait, as due to its relatively high inheritance chance despite low birth incidence rate, we were all too frequently seeing long lines of prestigious Dwarven Emperors and Popes in late-game.
		The Secret Society of Dwarven Aristocracy is nonplussed.
	AI will now always be open to pressing an anti-Pope's claim on the Papal State or Fraticelli Papacy, regardless of whether they'll be able to vassalize the new Pope upon success
	Republics can now seize cities/counties w/i 250 distance of any realm county (instead of 200)
	Vassal patricians in a republic now consider all of the republic's realm provinces when calculating distance to targets for CB restrictions (i.e., all provinces in the Doge's subrealm rather than their own)
	Winning a war or holy war as an ally now always triggers success of their respective war ambitions for all CBs
	The *Imperial Reconquest CB* will no longer automatically usurp Papal State holdings above baron-tier and not in counties that are directly held by the Papal State at all (unless the war is actually against the Papacy)
	Nomadic county liberation now has a truce of 3 years (instead of 5)
	*Muslim County Conquest*, when a religious war and when vassalizing the target rather than usurping the county (due to the target being a count without any other county titles), now gives a proper "Subjugated By Different Religion" temporary opinion bonus (+45)
	Regents will no longer screw with your Crown Authority pathologically
	The *Decadence Usurpation CB* will no longer be capable of usurping holy order / mercenary / religious-head titles (unless same religion for the religious-head titles)
	FIX: Fixed a bug wherein certain AI vassals could use the *Bid For Independence* CB where they should not be able to do so
	FIX: The new *Become King* ambition icon now works properly. Thank you GIMP, for still being junk at exporting DDS
	FIX: Correct event option text when fulfilling the *Change a Province's Culture* ambition


EMF 4.03 [2015-10-23]
	***Province Culture & Religion Preservation:***
		Some of you may have noticed that activation of the Horse Lords DLC erases original (i.e., intended) province culture and religion under nomads to be mono-cultural. We've written a "province history enforcement" supplement called **antinomad** that restores the originally intended province culture & religion under nomads when starting a new campaign with Horse Lords enabled.
			Works as intended at literally all start dates!
			Works for the SWMH map, vanilla map, and even the modified CK2Plus map (**antinomad** was donated to Plus for this release as well-- you've just got to have it, after all); note that EMF and CK2Plus are not compatible, however.
			Will only apply to new campaigns.
			Nomads conquering otherwise "empty" land from a different-culture or different-religion nomad now also kicks-in the new Leave A Tribe Behind™ mechanic, to prevent automatic province culture/religion erasure due to Horse Lords mechanics.
	***Ambitions***:
		28 (twenty-eight!) new ambitions, often tiered, have been added to ensure that you always have something interesting from which to choose from your ambition list:
			*Become Duke*
			*Become a Great Duke*
			*Become Emperor*
			*Gain Independence*
			*Have Five Children*
			*Have Ten Children*
			*Have Fifteen Children*
			*Have Twenty Children*
			*Increase Size of Demesne:* an ambition for each demesne size of 1-12
			*Lower Decadence:* 7 tiered decadence ambitions that kick-in at 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, and 80 decadence each with the aim of reducing decadence by 10, can be repeated on a 5-year cooldown
			*Assemble a Great Council:* Put together a council wherein no councillor has a skill level of less than 18
			*Change a Province's Culture:* Not too dissimilar from *Convert a Province*, but prepare for a longer wait. If you do want to spread your obscure culture in the game, then this ambition is for you. Note that it applies to any provinces under you rather than just those directly owned by you [player-only].
			*Increase Personal Combat Skill* ambitions have been updated significantly:
				Characters with the new commander minor title are much more likely to want to increase their personal combat skill
				Christian religious heads will never take the ambition
				Ambition now has up-to-date requirements regarding who can lead troops
				General objective AI chance rebalancing
	***Scenario Customization Decisions:***
		*New World Order* has been restored for CKII v2.4/HL.
			You'll now get 3 additional options for how to handle nomads, as they don't follow the normal de jure rules that non-nomads do:
				Make each clan independent-- all vassal clans will become independent, but no new clans will be generated
				Give each clan a single province-- one county per Khaganate, and new clans will be generated to fill the holes (this is the most like 'Independent Counts' for nomads)
				Leave nomads alone-- you guessed it, simply leaves nomadic realms alone
			Now respects the *Gender Equality* customization and generates female rulers at a 50/50 ratio when applicable
			Patricians can no longer use the "Rapid Conquest" CBs
		*Gender Equality:*
			Customization has been revamped, giving 3 independent options:
				Gender-equal council (excludes the Marshal position)
				Gender-equal military (includes the Marshal position and determines who can lead troops / be a commander)
				Full Gender Equality: Every title in the game for which *Absolute Cognatic* succession is an option will use *Absolute Cognatic*, and the AI will never change it back, nor will new titles use *Agnatic* succession when they should use *Absolute Cognatic*
					In addition to rewriting the gender succession laws to make this possible, there are still cases where the hard-code will give *Agnatic* succession to newly-created characters, and these are caught on a yearly maintenance pulse which corrects them to *Absolute Cognatic* if they qualify
			No longer gives access to the buggy *Enatic* and *Enatic-Cognatic* succession laws
	*Council and Succession:*
		Barring other exclusionary rules, all council positions may be held by a woman if cathar, messalian, bogomilist, or mazdaki and their liege is the same religion
		Characters with the monk or nun trait, if other rules allow, will now be allowed to be appointed to the court chaplain position with religions & government forms that otherwise require them to already be a landed priest/priestess (e.g., those with autocephaly)
		Dismissing a councillor that's become incapable or has gone into hiding no longer earns you a "Fired From Council" opinion malus
		"Job Security Concerns" (a small opinion malus earned from a councillor when they're fired and later re-hired) can no longer stack
		Can now jump straight to *Absolute Cognatic* succession if religion is mazdaki in addition to messalian religion and basque culture
		If your religion/culture qualifies for jumping straight to *Absolute Cognatic*, there is no minimum prestige requirement for doing so
	*Religious Authority and Province Conversion:*
		Province religious conversion via the 'Proselytize' job action now always takes +25% more time on average
		Due to an effective imbalance in relative Religious Authority for Muslims:
			Muslims may call Jihad with as low as 30% RA rather than the usual 40% required
			Sunni, Shia, and Ibadi religions receive a permanent +10% religious authority on scenario startup (new campaigns only)
		Provinces under Islamic control now spontaneously convert to the owner's religion twice as fast (was previously very slow) and earn a 5-year +1% religious authority as they would if converted by the 'Proselytize' job action
	(EMF+SWMH) Seljuk will no longer spawn in mercenary courts or any other foolish place for launching a subsequent invasion
	(EMF+SWMH) *Manifest Destiny Invasion* CB (special invasion CB for Seljuks and Timurids) now targets the whole intended conquest region for both dynasties (did not previously due to lack of all de jure empires in that area on SWMH)
	Leave A Tribe Behind™ now ensures that the new tribe will be a minor holding in the previously-empty province (not the capital) when the conqueror is nomadic
	EMF's regional weather effects no longer affect Garrison Size, because this can have confusing effects on the locally available levy
	Upon major revolt invalidation, the temporary Levy Efficiency laws that were applicable during the war for the revolt leader and the liege are now, in addition to the other possible war outcomes, corrected immediately
	*Make Tribute* CB will now less commonly be used against players than previously (normally, we encourage AIs to use available CBs against players over other targets, but in this case, it's a bit spammy, because the CB is virtually always available)
	*Make Tribute* CB will be less commonly used by non-Muslim feudal rulers against other non-Muslim feudal rulers
	The decision *Raise Tribal Army* has been removed due to the sheer and implausible advantage and opportunity for abuse that it gives players.
	Characters ages 50+ and especially 60+ have less health reduction due to the 'Old Age' and 'Very Old Age' modifiers, respectively.
	AI will now *prefer* a direct land border (as opposed to traversing a sea zone) when using any of the relevant duchy-tier holy war CBs
	If a reformed pagan, the *Holy War* CB can no longer be used against targets of your unreformed faith
	*Special Holy War* CB can now be used by either any holy order against a target in another religion group or by the King of Jerusalem for a de jure duchy within Jerusalem against a target in another religion group
	*Special Holy War* CB no longer induces a holy war cooldown
	*Religious Reconquest* CB now requires at least one of the same-religion provinces in the target duchy to be non-nomadic
	Non-nomads can no longer holy war for duchies that lack any non-nomadic settlements
	Nomad settlement: more hardcode-induced border gore reduction
	(EMF+SWMH) FIX: Standard culture conversion events should now prevent Geat-cultured provinces from flipping back to Norse before their time
	(EMF+SWMH) FIX: Culture/religion conversion modifiers to promote inland Turkmenification and discourage it coastally in the Rum/Byzantium areas now work properly again (SWMH EE changed the underlying cultures at work)
	FIX: Properly adjust Levy Efficiency laws for the liege and major revolt leader in the case of 3rd-party revolts (e.g., Claimant wars)
	FIX: Usurpation of single-holding provinces containing a nomad capital should now still Leave a Tribe Behind™ when supposed to do so (but it won't appear until the next game day)
	FIX: Nomads can no longer use the *Religious Reconquest* CB
	FIX: Nomads settling as merchant republics will now properly use the new post-settlement mechanics
		If a nomad settled as a republic in an EMF 4.02 save, it may have left behind stray game state which could mess with future settlement of the prior nomadic realm's territory, even if as feudal. However, upgrading to this version of EMF will dynamically fix any such stray game state automatically.
	MINOR: Pagan and non-pagan versions of the *Holy War* CB merged into one
	MINOR: Base fertility modifier dropped to -10% from -5%


EMF 4.02 [2015-10-04]
	***HIGHLIGHTS:***
		A new historical CB for the TOG start to promote AI formation of the HRE and a generally more spicey European political climate
			If you definitely want to see an HRE form, a very effective way is to endow a King in the "Frankish Realm" with Lucky Ruler status.
		Major improvements to nomad settlement as feudal, tribal, or a republic (incl. major border gore reduction measures)
		New mechanics for conquered empty provinces and AI nomad behavior which tend to:
			Preserve original culture/religion
			Provide a more natural path for AI and players alike to develop land liberated from nomads
			To much better model the evolution of sedentary customs and governmental organization from the nomadic way of life
		New mechanics for upgrading tribal settlements
		Automatic empire disintegration improvements
		More successful and aggressive Merchant Republics / patricians
		AI Muslims should now live a slightly less punished life and be able to be more aggressive toward each other
		Performance boosts (actually noticeable with EMF+SWMH rather than just a subliminal quality-of-life improvement)
		Major fixes which:
			Enable the Mongol invasion to properly rock all the time
			Enable the Seljuks' dynamic formation of Rum
			Allow characters affected by the Baqt to be played without being spammed with a few hundred events at startup
			Eliminate the root cause of the [vanilla] issue regarding mysterious appearance/accumulation of event troops
			Eliminate dozens of vanilla / patch 2.4 bugs introduced to CBs, in settlement decisions (pillage, conversion of tribal settlements to other settlement types, nomad settlement as feudal|tribe|republic), for all changes of government form, etc.
	***SOME OF THE DETAILS:***
		*HRE formation from 867 start:*
			Rewrote Holy Roman Unification CB to be more permissive, toward the end of promoting unification / formation of the HRE
				CB is currently now AI-only, but a player version will be added again.
				CB is now valid until 967 (100 years from start) OR 30 years following the last successful usage of the CB
				Most of its additional permissiveness is not valid vs. player targets.
				Lucky Rulers are able to use it under many more circumstances than others and will thus be considerably more likely to be able to form the HRE, if they're King of one of the de jure kingdom titles that once constituted the Carolingien Empire / Frankish Realm (France, Aquitaine, Italy, Lotharingia, Burgundy, Germany, and Bavaria).
				Expanded target kingdom preference modifiers to promote better borders, more plausible conquest
				(EMF+SWMH) FIX: All of the new German subcultures in SWMH can use it now
			(EMF+SWMH) FIX: When forming the western/Frankish HRE, Duchy of Alsace is now properly a de jure vassal of the empire (but Alsace still transfers to the standard/German HRE if it is formed instead)
		*Mongol Invasion:*
			Should now always start conquest in the correct location, and the EMF supplementary AI code ("pillage-burn") for their subsequent invasions will now always be able to do its glorious job
			Supplementary AI code will now respect marriage alliances when choosing invasion targets (hard-coded AI may still attack as per normal, however)
		*Nomads, nomads, nomads:*
			Settlement code rewritten to reduce border gore and increase capital-connectedness of both the settled realm and the prior nomadic realm
			Settlement as a tribe and as a republic now benefits from the same intelligently-clustered culture/religion conversion code that settlement-as-feudal received in the prior release
			Whenever a nomadic province is conquered by a non-nomad, the portion of the original nomadic population which did not migrate upon conquest settles as a small tribe in the province, preserving the original culture/religion and providing a more natural and direct path for further development
			AI nomads will now never destroy the last settlement in a different-culture province by mindlessly burning it all to the ground and will instead prefer to preserve it for more future pillaging (players may choose to raze it all for the hell of it, though)
			The 'Pillage Settlement' tooltips are much more concise and actually correct (e.g., informing you when the settlement is too weak to survive any more pillaging and will be destroyed vs. when only a building or two might be destroyed)
				Consequently, the information now actually fits in the diplomacy interaction window, rather than being unable to see most of it (and the most important parts of it at that)
			The 'Pillage Settlement' decision no longer exhibits a ton of vanilla bugs with some pretty strange and undesirable consequences
			The anti-nomad 'Liberation' CB has been replaced with a custom EMF CB
				It may only be used to conquer one county at a time
				It now requires the attacker to have a direct border with the target county
				It can no longer be used for "liberating" the Sahara Desert
				It is properly hidden when Pagan County Conquest or Muslim County Conquest could be used instead
		*Tribes:*
			Settlement conversion/upgrade no longer also instantly auto-builds a city and temple at no cost/time, a silly behavior introduced in patch 2.4 and now reversed
				Event chains to help bootstrap the ex-tribal county's economy with the foundation of more settlements in a much more flavorful, gradual, and natural manner are coming soon
			Theocracies may now convert tribal settlements to prince-bishoprics
			Settlement conversion/upgrade once already feudal, republican, or theocratic can now also be done for 100 gold, rather than requiring maxing-out the government-type-associated tribal building type (but doing so means that fewer tribal buildings will be automatically converted to their counterparts in the new settlement)
			The levy of a newly-converted/upgraded ex-tribal settlement will now be properly refilled after a few game days, rather than completely depleted
		*Convert to Merchant Republic*:
			Now allows the day-1 diplo-action target or yourself to be feudal OR a regular republican (count-tier)
			If there is no city in the ruler's capital province but one can be built, one will be built and the customization will still be available for that ruler
			No longer allows Muslim targets (in patch 2.4, Paradox disallowed Muslims from having the Merchant Republic government type)
		*Automatic Empire Disintegration*:
			AED now requires the HRE to always have at least 150 realm size (other empires only require 100, except for the ERE / Latin Empire which require Constantinople)
			If AED couldn't find an appropriate kingdom title to fallback upon with its usual methods (that is, neither the ruler's capital kingdom nor any de jure vassal kingdom of his empire title passed the "50% rule" for title creation), it now also:
				Searches every single de jure kingdom title in the game for one which passes the 50% rule (at least half of its de jure counties must be controlled by the emperor)-- very useful if the empire was titular (e.g., just-settled nomads)
				And if that fails too, it creates a titular kingdom title based upon the emperor's capital county title (i.e., its map color will be related to the county's color, its name will be the same, and it will have the same CoA)
		Decadence revolts are now less severe and can only fire when decadence is at least 75% (now closely resembles vanilla)
		Imperial Reconquest CB now additionally usurps the target duchy title if held by a ruler whom was vassalized as a result of the war (instead of only when the enemy top liege directly held the title), if your empire has the Imperial Administration law and the Charlemagne DLC is active (allows conversion to a viceroyalty without tyranny)
		When rulers are over vassal limit upon succession, they'll no longer randomly lose AI vassals unless those vassals are on the border of their liege's [sub-]realm
		Normally, the AI must be of a certain size or tier to purchase retinues (leads to better AI performance, both literally and in terms of how they manage their money and armies). *However*, all AI patricians are now exempt from these EMF restrictions.
		Muslims may now use *County Conquest* against pagans too (with a holy war cooldown, if they're enabled)
		The *Convert a Province* ambition now no longer gives the same "random" reward throughout a ruler's lifetime and is now properly random
		The *Win a War* and *Win a Holy War* ambitions now have zero delay before you can reselect them
		The College of Cardinals now weights the Dynasty Prestige of a prospective Cardinal / Pope -60% less than previously (awarded elector points are now equal to 1% of total dynasty prestige rather 2.5%)
		Muslims at war with each other now only lose 1 piety/month while at war rather than 2; this should promote more intra-religious aggression besides revolts
		*Performance Boost*: the engine will now only evaluate MTTH events for every character once every 30 days rather than 20 (will not affect the statistical frequency of events occurring, only reduce processing overhead-- EMF doesn't rely upon any MTTH events to be evaluated any more frequently than once a month through careful design, so it's a win-win)
		(EMF+SWMH) FIX: Moravians now have a cultural retinue: the Rytír retinue of 3:2 knights and light cavalry, like their Bohemian neighbors
		(EMF+SWMH) FIX: Turkmen now have a cultural retinue (the same as Türk culture, both of which differ from the general Altaic retinue)
		(EMF+SWMH) FIX: Seljuks should now usually succeed at forming Rum from the 1066 start once again (and from pre-1066 if they come into power somewhat historically)
		(Vanilla Map) FIX: Starting a 'Find Title' search with the letter 's' will no longer crash the game
		FIX: Since patch 2.4, the 10-year opinion malus for raising *Crown Authority* or one of the CA sub-laws was erroneously doubled and is now -15 per law/sub-law again
		FIX: Rivalry CB should now work properly with respect to suzerainty
		VANILLA FIX: Ghost armies of event troops belonging to seemingly random rulers should now no longer appear (a root cause that's been present since TOG but apparently only an issue since 2.4/HL)
		VANILLA FIX: Pagan and Nomad Subjugation CBs had several errors and omissions introduced in patch 2.4
		MINOR: Below *Medium Tribal Organization*, any *Tribal Obligations* or *Tribal Focus* laws are removed


EMF 4.01 [2015-09-01]
	Crusader and Mujahid traits no longer award martial skill
	Vanilla map: Duchy of Flanders de jure moved to Kingdom of France
	SWMH map:
		Manual advancement of start date in the game lobby has been extended to 1337.1.1, like vanilla (still no bookmarks after 1205, though)
		Castle cultural buildings and cultural retinues have been added for the new German sub-cultures in SWMH, along with the Szekely
		Gothic/Geat culture now has a heavy infantry cultural retinue
		Cultural modifiers have been streamlined and balanced
		FIX: Romanian and Albanians will no longer have two different cultural buildings, and Albanians now have a retinue
		FIX: Robert Guiscard no longer has an overlapping war (2 CBs at once) in the Alexiad (1081) start
		MINOR: De jure Irish kingdom title no longer automatically destroyed upon scenario start; this should no longer be an issue with SWMH
	Mongol Empire:
		Invasion is now firmly guided to follow historical patterns (almost entirely without railroading it!)
		To address the issue of pacifist Mongols (an extreme problem on SWMH but also an annoyance on the vanilla map), EMF now has supplementary AI code ("pillage-burn") that forces a shock-and-awe invasion with multiple simultaneous wars, relatively smart target selection, and other neat tricks to better represent the extremely aggressive and rapid expansion of the Mongol Scourge.
		Invasion uses a custom CB designed to minimize the unlanding of original characters and their subsequent replacement with Mongol-cultured feudal lords. The Mongols were indeed rather "hands-off" overlords, and it should be much more fun to be conquered by the Mongols (merely the beginning of a new era rather than a reason to ragequit)!
		Mongol Empire will no longer convert away from the Tengri faith until at least 30 years after its arrival.
		The *Conqueror* trait (which makes characters particularly ruthless) will stop being applied to Mongol invaders after the year 1300
	Magyars:
		Starting troops in 867 are now sufficient to beat Bulgaria and properly wreak some havoc on Eastern Europe
		Their 867 invasion now uses a custom CB and extended event chain which properly migrates them in a way similar to that done previously to the release of Horse Lords, and it is much more robust for their purposes.
		Those without Horse Lords are also fully-supported by the new CB, events, and decision.
		Less overpowered than in previous releases (excluding the prior EMF 4.0, which had reverted to the poor vanilla event troop setup)
		Migration code respects player vassals of the Magyars, unlike previous code, and will never eliminate them.
	Elective monarchy faction logic significantly improved, toward the goal of generally reducing the faction's likelihood to revolt
	Robert Guiscard's 5 Norman-Byzantine Wars from 1066 until his death have been removed in favor of an invasion of the Balkans in 1081.4.1 (Alexiad start), for historical accuracy
		However, it is likely that his earlier Italian campaigns against the ERE will receive special treatment (with a custom CB) in the future.
	Rewrote *Remove Ahistorical Empires* scenario customization for more simplicity and robustness
		FIX: Will no longer deactivate an ahistorical empire title if it is actually held (but will still make it titular-- notably affects Abbasids in 769)
	Nomad settlement to feudal:
		Completely rewritten province culture/religion conversion logic (number of provinces proportional to population+manpower) to settle your non-nomadic lands in a much more contiguous/clustered and intuitive, aesthetically-pleasing way. This is also a vanilla bugfix, because their method was completely faulty.
		Players settling-down get to keep their previous demesne nomadic provinces (no point in forcing you to go to Liberation wars to regain control of the land you already controlled directly)
		Nomads spawn 2x less one-time event troops, proportional to number of empty holding slots abandoned, than previously.
	Nomad lucky rulers now gain some significant benefits as well (previously, the status was only a major boon for feudal/iqta rulers-- we're still working upon improving the bonuses for tribals, although it still makes a big difference for them)
	FIX: The per-crown-title lifetime cooldown upon changes to Investiture Law is now properly reset upon title inheritance
	FIX: Can now properly create the Frankish HRE when also using using *Remove Ahistorical Empires* scenario customization decision
	FIX: *Adopt Feudalism* decision should now always be enabled when its tooltip indicates that it should be
	FIX: The Seljuks will no longer immediately lose their titular empire-tier title gained when they first spawn/invade (pre-1066 starts)
	FIX: Some misfiring PB events related to 'retaking the coast' and the Bulgarian unrest have been removed temporarily due to misbehavior
	FIX: All those eligible to be marshals are now also eligible to receive the Commander minor title (prior, many EMF extensions to command eligibility were disregarded)
	VANILLA FIX: Reduced the odds of an AI character with theology focus taking the option to become a heretic from 33% to 20%
	VANILLA FIX: (Hopefully) stopped spurious 'minor clan reinforcements' event for unrelated provincial revolts (stopgap)
	VANILLA FIX: Upon scenario initialization, virtually every king-tier title in the game is given an [uncreatable] placeholder de jure empire when they otherwise lack a de jure empire
		Without this measure, the engine currently appears to have various issues with memory leaks, crashes, and buggy behavior.
		Mechanism for plugging de jure empire gaps is similar to that used for *Remove Ahistorical Empires* (though no titles are deactivated!).
	MINOR: Crown Authority law increases no longer require at least 1 year to have passed since the title holder has changed his/her primary title


EMF 4.0 [2015-08-16]
	Compatible with CKII v2.4.3
	Nomads:
		Settling as feudal or republican now:
			Clusters the provinces converted to your culture/religion (amount dependent upon your population+manpower) to be contiguous and likely centered around the new capital, rather than picked entirely at random
			Actually spawns troops exactly proportionate to the number of empty holding slots which are being "abandoned" (vanilla tooltip lies about this)
	New region-based implementation of EMF's tiered Imperial Reconquest CB (thanks @IoannesBarbarus)
		New *Imperial Reconquest Tier* decisions and utility event chain that explicitly show you what provinces you've yet to completely-control in your current conquest tier. No more endless searching for independent holy order baronies in your bustling empire!
	(EMF+SWMH) Bookmarks after 1205 removed due to lack of SWMH support for those later start dates at this time
	HRE formation in TOG start:
		Now has a supporting historical CB for reuniting the traditional Carolingien kingdoms to make plausible formation of the HRE much more likely (eventually)
			Can be used strategically by non-Karlings to have a chance at forming the HRE themselves
			Serves predominantly in the form of an "expanded weak claim" CB, although it does not always require actual claims if the conditions are right
		Now offers a 'Form the Frankish HRE' alt-history option for the Western Carolingien kingdom holders (different de jure setup, etc.)
		Once one of the HREs has been formed, the new emperor will have 10-year time-limited usage of a new *De Jure Kingdom Claim* CB against targets of the same religion group within the empire's new de jure borders
	Vassal limit is now half as valuable relative to demesne cap bonus on the Centralization law slider
	Logic for AI change of Centralization law changed to be much more robust; AI should manage vassal limit more efficiently
	Direct trait-based restrictions upon holy war lifted for AI
	*Third-Party Claim* CB:
		CB tooltip now clearly shows whether the claimant will become / remain or not become your vassal upon successfully pressing their claim.
		Mechanic change: Install claimants *into* other realms.
			When a claimant would not become your vassal after pressing their claim, they may now become the vassal of the prior liege to the title they've claimed. Previously, it was likely that they'd just become independent. If this applies, their new liege will also be clearly shown in the CB tooltip.
		Various AI restrictions removed from using the CB (such as needing certain traits to press claims against "allied" top-lieges), but the AI will now no longer use it at all unless it would gain them territory *EXCEPT* when the war could somehow tangle with a player-- even if just allied with the target-- in the name of chaos promotion.
		AI emperors are normally quite restricted for whom they will push claims (close relatives, same dynasty, friends, spouse(s)), but they will now push claims for any otherwise valid claimant when the defender is a player
	The Jomsvikings can now form after religion reformation just like other pagan holy orders. Vanilla events can still create them earlier. Rejoice, ye armchair Viking warriors.
	Command veteran traits are now harder to gain/advance
	Court Banishment fixes:
		The court banishment action will no longer show up in the player's own diplomatic menu.
		Banished courtiers of a different religion will now always leave the player's realm.
		Players with no vassals in their realm, or with only baron tier vassals, will now be able to banish courtiers properly. However, if there are no eligible courts in their realm, the banished courtiers will leave the player's realm.
	Building tax income and maintenance model:
		Castle, temple, and city buildings which cost maintenance (i.e., all that don't generate tax, except for universities/schools) no longer stack net maintenance cost per building level quadratically (each building upgrade costs the same amount of additional maintenance)
		Income-generating castle buildings (town and walls) no longer ramp-up net tax income with building level nonlinearly (due to the holdings' agrarian, feudal economic model), but relatively, they generate more income than previously early in the game
			Similarly, temple income-generation has been slightly altered to be more linear and favor early and mid-game relative to cities, after which they are definitely outclassed economically
	*De Jure Duchy Claim* CB:
		Now requires Medium CA or greater in the the held de jure kingdom or de jure empire *of the target duchy*
		MAJOR FIX: When the CB was not available due to its [previous] CA restrictions, it would occasionally still appear as a CB (but not usable). More importantly, when it did this, it would prevent valid, corresponding De Jure County Claim CB (which doesn't require CA) instances from being available. [Became an issue a couple releases ago (when crown laws were overhauled).]
	FIX: Proper handling of patrician family extinction in the case of the Doge himself
	FIX: Siege module should no longer allow some type of rebels to take prisoners
	FIX: When using *Remove Ahistorical Empires*, one will no longer see a funky "E-EMF-NULL" on the de jure empires map mode (issue introduced last release)
	FIX: Crier module will no longer announce the formation of the Mongol Empire or general nomadic titles
	VANILLA FIX: The 'Magyar' tribal title is now destroyed and deactivated upon formation of Hungary (could pop back up through elective gavelkind inheritance)


EMF 3.11 [2015-05-08]
	**New feature:** *Banish from Court*
		Players may now banish extraneous courtiers from their courts, assuming that courtier is not a child, not employed officially, and not a prisoner.
		Banished courtiers of the same religion will find another court in the player's realm to call home, while those of a different religion will attempt to flee to another realm with the same religion, if such exists.
	**New feature:** *Expanded decision menu*
		The intrigue screen now features a larger decision menu, capable of displaying 7 decisions at once compared to vanilla's puny 4. It can also now display an additional available and backed plot, which is *definitely* the most popular EMF feature request. You can tell by all the forum threads about it. You're welcome.
		The dimensions of the intrigue screen are unchanged, meaning this feature retains compatibility with the same display resolutions as vanilla CKII.
	**New module:** *Crier*
		Adds some flavorful announcements to relatively rare events in the game world, along with small, related mechanics.
		List of announcements currently include:
			Religion Head sacrificed by another faith
			Empire formation
			Empire disintegration
			Player death (Multiplayer only)
		Other events may be added in the future.
	**New CB:** *Subjugation*
		Usurps no titles, force-vassalizes the target, and gives them a temporary Subjugated opinion bonus (to offset the declaration of war)
		Can be used by duke- or higher-tier rulers against count- or higher-tier rulers of the same religion (though target must be lower-tier)
		*ALL* non-titular, count- or higher-tier titles of the target must be de jure vassals of a title held within the attacker's [sub-]realm (i.e., held personally or by vassals).
		Cannot be used on mercenaries, holy orders, the Pope, etc.
		To be used on counts, no *Crown Authority* is required.
		To be used on dukes, it requires the target to be subject to a crown title held by you or one of your vassals that has at least *Medium Crown Authority*.
		To be used on kings, it requires the target to be subject to a crown title held by you or one of your vassals that has at least *High Crown Authority*.
		This is now a way to vassalize an existing Merchant Republic without destroying it in the process.
	New HRE formation decision and EMF+SWMH de jure setup in the 867 start that should improve how and when the HRE can be formed (new campaign required for proper effect)
	Merchant Republics:
		When a patrician house goes extinct, it is now replaced with what is likely to be a powerful existing vassal of the Doge rather than a pathetic new, random house
			Assassinate your rivals into the ground, if you dare: one goes down, another pops-up.
		*Convert to Merchant Republic:*
			AI patricians in the new merchant republic will now almost surely receive a city of their own, usually converted into a county capital, so they will be far better competition for the Doge as well as more prosperous.
			During republic conversion, extra corner cases more neatly covered when severing ties to previous realm, becoming independent duchy, and ensuring control over all titles in duchy
	New ruler demesne distribution mechanic upon scenario initialization:
		If a feudal ruler has excess demesne capacity at startup, they will seize feudal baronies from randomly-generated feudal vassal barons
		First, they will seize what they can in their capital county (until no more capacity).
		Second, they will seize what they can in their capital duchy (until no more capacity).
		Finally, they will seize what they can in their general demesne (until no more capacity).
		When such a random vassal baron becomes consequently unlanded and is not already assigned as a councillor, they will be killed (fewer living characters).
		Historical barons are exempt.
	Muslims no longer enjoy +1 demesne limit as a religion property
	Castle, temple, and city buildings which add levy_size and garrison_size modifiers have been buffed (returned to vanilla for the most part)
	Realm intrigue (personal + any spouse contribution + spymaster) now inherently improves plot power
	(EMF+SWMH) Base, tier-derived demesne limit raised by +1 for count- and above-tier rulers (reversal of change from prior release, SWMH has many small/low-capacity provinces)
	(EMF+SWMH) Duke-tier base vassal limit dropped to vanilla (10-- 15 if a great-duke); king- and emperor-tiers also relatively dropped but still greater than vanilla map (each +5 from vanilla)
	(EMF+SWMH) Tribal garrison and levy empty holding slot modifiers reduced to vanilla (+50%) while tax left heightened (+70%) due to some province (over-)density issues in Scandinavia
	FIX: *Automatic Empire Disintegration* previously had the potential to grant more than one kingdom (indeed, all de jure vassal kingdoms that aren't held and pass the 50% rule) to the ex-emperor, due to a patch change
	FIX: Command veteran trait effects toned-down to work as originally intended (a code merge error in the last release let some old code into the release; main differences now are no diplomacy boosts at higher tiers and less martial boost)
	FIX: Center "flank" leaders should now also be eligible for command veteran traits, earned through major victorious battles
	FIX: *Free Infidel Revocation* now appropriately gives twice the opinion malus to all ruler classes as *Title Revocation Allowed*
	FIX: *Complete King's Peace* now appropriately gives twice the opinion malus to feudal rulers as *Internal King's Peace*


EMF 3.10 [2015-04-24]
	Updated for CKII v2.3.4
	Siege module updates:
		The AI is now significantly less likely to get permanently stuck In Hiding
		The AI can once again choose to massacre the occupants of a holding at the end of a siege, but is unlikely to do so
		Players will get informed if a massacre occurs at their holding
		FIX: Will no longer confuse looting with recapturing friendly holdings
	Added new trait: Raider. Works exactly like the Viking trait, except made generic and available to other raiding religions. (This is also the first VIET feature imported into EMF.)
	(EMF+ArkoCoA) New compatch EMF+ArkoCoA will only enable random CoA for pagans when co-installed with ARKOpack Armoiries (CoA)
	*Dynamic Flags:* When ArkoCoA isn't used, a pagan England will use its proper non-Christian CoA (and when it is used, all pagan CoA are dynasty CoA, so it isn't an issue)
	Crown laws:
		Like raising Crown Authority, there is now a lifetime, per-title cooldown upon any Investiture crown law changes
			It is independent of the Crown Authority cooldown; a single ruler can raise Crown Authority and change Investiture law on the same crown title
		AI rulers will now more aggressively try to raise Crown Authority as high as possible
		Temporary opinion malus from raising crown authority laws (the master slider or the specific laws) is now applied to *all rulers actually affected by the crown law title* (rather than the title's de jure vassals)
			This includes rulers not in your [sub-]realm (or even your realm at all) but still of your religion.
			In situations where your crown law title applies outside of its de jure territory (e.g., when it is your primary title and the area otherwise has no active crown law title), more rulers will now be upset.
			In situations where another crown law title affects some of the title's de jure vassals (such as a kingdom that you or another holds within an empire), fewer rulers will now be upset.
			Reminder: The applied crown law title for a ruler depends upon the location of his/her capital. Thus, vassals whose demesne or sub-realm span multiple crown law titles in which you raise CA will not stack separate opinion maluses (unless the Elves of Mechanics & Flavor change their mind).
		AI characters are now significantly more likely to want to join/create a faction to lower crown authority if any of their liege's King's Peace laws negatively affect a player's ability to wage war
			This is purely to improve the player-as-vassal experience: AIs are already appropriately upset even if no players are around.
			Note that this modifier was already in place for the faction to lower crown authority, but it has been amped-up significantly.
		FIX: When the AI gains a crown law title from a player through grant/inheritance and that player had not fully enforced all of the title's Crown Authority (i.e., passed all the unlocked crown laws, like *Free Infidel Revocation* and *Internal King's Peace* for a title at Medium CA), the AI will now proceed to pass whatever laws that it can, rather than leave them alone until it next raises CA (or a revolt reduces CA)
		FIX: Title revocation laws were not showing a tooltip indicating that they would incur a 10-year opinion malus (unlike the rest)
	Command veteran traits:
		Military commanders will now distinguish themselves through major victories in battle, earning command veteran traits.
		These traits are tiered; there are 4 of them, each with increasing positive effects.
		The 'Fighter' (personal combat) traits now no longer give martial or vassal_opinion bonuses, as the Command traits now do (martial is about command, not merely personal combat).
		Later, more flavor will be added when earning these traits as well as a chance for the highest-tier commanders to earn weak claims on their liege's primary title as a result of major victories.
	*Remove Ahistorical Empires*:
		Now uses a different technique for removing ahistorical empire titles that persists across save/reload and allows proper de jure empire assimilation
		On the vanilla map, the Wendish Empire, the Empire of Germany, and the three Indian empires will now be properly removed.
		NOTE: Due to a limitation rumored to be addressed in the next patch, the game depends upon certain ahistorical de jure empires being in place for some regionalization (e.g., tiger hunts in India or the AI target title / conquest path preferences for certain CBs).
			Therefore, if you choose to use this customization, don't be surprised if certain region-specific logic doesn't work as expected (the above two cases being the most obvious at the time of this writing), but nothing terribly important should be affected.
	Formation of the HRE will make the HRE de jure instantly on the vanilla map and no longer requires/costs 2 years of income (on SWMH, the HRE is already de jure)
	Halfdan Hvitserk (Jorvik)'s event troops now *ALL* disband once he's at peace. Previously (and in vanilla), a large amount of them remained after their initial scripted invasions, wreaking havoc on Britannia for untold decades. Screw that guy.
	Inter-Muslim war now costs 2 piety/month (now the vanilla rate, previously drained piety half as fast)
	(EMF+SWMH) Base, tier-derived demesne limit lowered for count- and higher-tier rulers to their vanilla values (previously, they were +1 from vanilla map)
	Demesne limit bonus for rulers with Gavelkind or Elective Gavelkind succession significantly increased (+50% of base, tier-derived limit-- vanilla is +30%)
	Tribal stuff:
		Vanilla's *Build Zeal* job action (Court Chaplain) fixed-up to be more efficient and, most importantly, actually correct about the conditions for spawning and disbanding holy warriors (behavior should now make a lot more sense)
			TIP: Be sure to get involved in a religious war (any CB that is technically a holy war, of which there are quite a few), even as an allied participant, against a primary defender/attacker that is not of your religion by the time exactly 1 year has passed since the Zealots spawned. If you are *not* in such a religious war 1 year after they spawn, prepare to be judged.
		(EMF+SWMH) Bonus to demesne limit for tribals increased to 3 from 2 (SWMH has many small provinces)
		(EMF+SWMH) Levy, garrison, and tax bonus for each empty holding slot in a tribal province increased to +70%/slot from +50%/slot (same reason-- smaller-capacity provinces in typical tribal areas)
		Base levy of tribal holdings slightly boosted
		Base income of tribal holdings boosted; note that this raises the value of raiding them too (most non-Norse tribes have no other raiding options).
		Pagan Warrior Cult buildings have been removed for being needlessly punishing to Pagans who manage to convert to Feudalism.
			Coincidentally, with no cult to attend, Pagans now have a lot more free time and have taken up cooking and are thinking about getting a couple of rescue cats or a puppy.
	Reintroduced tax-generating 'Port' coastal city buildings and tweaked related city buildings
	Improved the efficacy of 'Construction' technology (now -4%/level on construction time and cost)
	Due to continued vanilla event chain bugs with the 'do_no_disturb' flag preventing certain decisions (e.g., pilgrimage) from being available indefinitely, EMF now forcibly removes the infamous flag if it's persisted for more than 2 years.
	Can now change WoL character focus after 3 years (was 4, and vanilla is 5)
	Councillors can now be instantly re-assigned without cooldown (needed for a feature described below, and previous cooldown was only 3 weeks anyway)
		To completely avoid an exploit that would be worsened by this, councillor deployment no longer lifts fog of war
	*Grant Recently Acquired Land*:
		In multiplayer mode, the high-priority version (i.e., when it displays an alert, which is only when you're over your demesne limit) will stop automatically granting provinces once you're no longer over your demesne limit
			If you want to continue granting provinces anyway, simply reinvoke the decision (though the high-priority alert will disappear)
		Now generates a decent starting council for all new, random characters as well as boosts one of their non-stewardship attributes by +5 (stewardship is already their specialty)
		Now respects the *Gender Equality* customization as well as simply having Absolute Cognatic, Enatic-Cognatic, or Enatic succession:
			Wherever appropriate, males and females will be generated with 50/50 odds (for new nobles as well as their councillors)
		Advanced feature: Mark provinces to keep with your chancellor (especially helpful for multiplayer, because multiplayer land distribution is one-click-- unlike singleplayer).
			To prevent a recently-acquired province from being considered by *Grant Recently Acquired Land*:
				1. Deploy your Chancellor with the 'Improve Relations' job action to any province in your demesne with the *Recently Acquired* modifier.
				2. Go to the decisions menu, and there will now be a new decision titled, e.g., *Keep Zeeland* with the same icon as *Grant Recently Acquired Land*. If it's not there, your chancellor is deployed incorrectly. Remember, provinces in your capital duchy are never distributed with *Grant Recently Acquired Land*, so don't even bother trying to 'Keep' any provinces in your capital duchy even if they are recently-acquired: don't worry, they're safe.
				3. Enact the decision to remove the *Recently Acquired* modifier from the province, making it no longer an automatic grant candidate.
				4. Repeat for any other provinces which you'd like to keep.
				5. Use *Grant Recently Acquired Land* as usual to grant whatever remains.
			Remember, in singleplayer, even if you don't use this advanced feature, you are still given the opportunity to skip granting any recently-acquired province when prompted for it. However, it is perfectly fine to use this in singleplayer as well.
	Merchant Republic CBs:
		Closed a "premature leapfrogging" loophole in the way the Seize City and Seize County CBs measured distance
		Removed AI trait restrictions on the Seize County CB
		Can now offer to join wars (both sides) with the Seize City or Seize County CBs (mostly for MP)
		Warscore earned from battles doubled in the Seize Trade Post CB (occupation warscore unchanged)
	Tribal Invasion CB:
		AI target preferences (encouraged conquest paths) for the il-Khanate, Golden Horde, and the Magyars now properly soft-coded in a way that will work on both SWMH and vanilla maps and is no longer heavy-handed
		No longer vassalizes the holder of the target de jure kingdom, even if he wasn't participating in the war
		Cleaned-up a lot of old code related to revolter subjugation and other vestigial stuff that doesn't matter anymore (but would have strange side-effects)
	Feasts and Hunts will now cancel immediately if there is an on-going war when they are scheduled to occur.
	AI will now occasionally shed an excess personality trait when they have 6 or more personality traits
	Summer Fairs will now delay until a summer without war.
	Republic city tax bonus modifiers (apply to province-capital holdings that are cities) reverted to vanilla values (previously were more liberal than vanilla in EMF)
	FIX: Attempting to imprison vassals would sometimes result in them declaring a war that would immediately invalidate
	FIX: Decision title for multiplayer *Grant Recently Acquired Land*, low-priority version (used when not over demesne limit), now correct (was showing `emf_autolander_auto_low_prio` instead)
	FIX: Cultural tactics now properly effective against standfast tactics
	FIX: il-Khanate, Golden Horde, and other landless empire titles now properly destroyed by *Automatic Empire Disintegration* under the right conditions
	VANILLA FIX: Decision *Restore Pope in Rome* is now player-only, and if the current holder of Rome is a vassal of the player, they must be AI-controlled. [Stops endless loop of de jure wars for Rome followed by granting the land right back to the Pope automatically.]
	VANILLA FIX: Decision *Restore the Ecumenical Patriarchate* no longer makes Hagia Sophia the capital barony of Constantinople. [Because that's, er, weird, and the AI shouldn't be entrusted with such matters.]
	VANILLA FIX: Event which ends a feast prematurely due to war now properly clears do_not_disturb flag
	MINOR: Removed various Papacy/anti-Papacy fixes/workarounds, as they should be addressed in patch 2.3.4


EMF 3.09 [2015-04-06]
	Adjusted Russian cultural combat tactic (now embolon_charge_tactic)
	FIX: Distribute Recently Acquired Land: Bug where the grant candidate's name on the event option did not match the tooltip, portrait, or actual grant
	FIX: Fixed Standfast combat tactics not being properly vulnerable due to a typo
	FIX: Fixed Greek cultural combat tactic (now embolon_charge_tactic)
	FIX: (EMF+SWMH) Restored certain Italian culture group retinues
	FIX: Independence faction will not fire without at least 100% faction power (previous behavior)


EMF 3.08 [2015-04-03]
	Crown Law Overhaul: Authority, Succession, and New Mechanics
		Crown laws have been overhauled to merge the classic configurability of PB/EMF-style laws with the strategic and challenge benefits afforded by usage of a "master" slider to represent Crown Authority itself.
		The Crown Authority slider unlocks different laws which can be passed (or not, if you so choose) at each level as well as different succession laws, casus belli, and other effects.
		Crown Authority may only be raised once per title per lifetime, while individual laws such as 'Free Infidel Title Revocation' or 'Protected Inheritance' may be configured at will without cooldown as long as the title has sufficient authority.
		All increases in crown authority, either directly through the master slider or through individual laws, incur a 10-year opinion malus from all de jure vassals of the title.
			If you've already raised Crown Authority and create a new crown title (rather than usurp, inherit, or otherwise gain it from another character), your lifetime cooldown is transferred to the new title automatically (no more exploitative creation with temporary primary titles nor being able to raise your primary title authority twice in one lifetime when creating an empire).
		Whenever a crown title is usurped (by any means whatsoever), its Crown Authority is automatically lowered by one tier, and all of its laws are adjusted accordingly.
		The Autonomy Faction has been disbanded and been replaced with a custom, realm-wide faction to lower crown authority (which is much more effective and correct than the one in vanilla).
			AI will be much more willing to wage a civil war to lower crown authority against lieges whom hold crown law titles that affect at least one player with any of the "King's Peace" laws (even when the player doesn't qualify for the faction).
			Unlike vanilla and the Autonomy Faction, the new faction allows rulers to revolt against vassal kings whenever the vassal kingdom's crown laws do indeed apply to the prospective faction member. Both vanilla and the AF only allowed such revolts against independent lieges.
			Unlike vanilla, the new faction isn't tied to a single crown title. Therefore, in realms where there are multiple crown titles, the whole realm can still unite in common cause to reduce crown authority, although their individual willingness to revolt is still largely dependent upon whichever crown laws affect them (and how much their particular interests are at stake due to them). Vanilla's faction model is fundamentally ineffective in such realms, because any given per-title faction will always be dwarfed by the rest of the realm, even if the majority of all vassals do want to revolt.
		Succession law requirements are now more tightly tied to crown authority, and the rules have now significantly changed. Summary:
			Primogeniture now requires High CA (4/5).
			Ultimogeniture now requires High CA (4/5), with the exception of Mongols.
			Tanistry remains unrestricted, for players.
			Feudal Elective, as it should be, is always an option (unless an unreformed Pagan or a Muslim, of course).
			Seniority now requires Medium CA (3/5).
			We will no longer see, e.g., the entire HRE switch from gavelkind straight to primogeniture directly after the Emperor passes but a single crown law.
		Each level beyond Autonomous Vassals (1/5) grants an additional +20% boost to the crown's minimum liege levy (i.e., makes the crown increasingly less dependent upon opinion to raise same-size armies), up to +80% at Absolute CA (5/5).
			If you should so choose to use your authority to pass the laws, Internal King's Peace will add +10% and Complete King's Peace will add another +10%. In other words, 100% (i.e., at maximum Levy Efficiency, a liege levy unaffected by vassal opinion) is possible at Absolute CA (5/5).
		Each level beyond Limited CA (2/5) provides an extra demesne size bonus to the crown, up to +3 at Absolute Crown Authority (5/5).
		Each level beyond Medium CA (3/5) provides a +20% boost to the crown's maximum liege levy, up to +40% at Absolute Crown Authority (5/5). Note that the maximum liege levy malus due to a large/huge realm size (Levy Efficiency) is only -50%!
		The "Emperor's Peace" laws are gone now. Whether you're an emperor or a king, the law is simply "King's Peace," and this means that when you create an empire, this law setting will properly copy to the empire instantly.
		Old savegames will automatically upgrade all crown titles to an appropriate Crown Authority slider setting, based upon their previous laws. No legal rights of the crown will be lost.
	New module: Sieges.
		Replaces the old Waylit Dungeons and Sieges system. Sieges now function differently depending on whether they're happening due to regular warfare or looting.
		During regular warfare:
			The capture of nobles and their families is common. Once a siege begins, any rulers present will have to choose whether to stay or attempt to escape. If the owner of the barony is present, their choices will determine the fate of both themselves and any of their family who are also present. If the owner is gone for some reason, any family present at the siege will try to escape on their own, but with reduced odds of success.
			Unlike the previous system, characters don't hide at the siege but instead attempt to escape it altogether. If successful, the escaped character will get the In Hiding trait. If unsuccessful, they will be stuck at the siege until it ends, whether by being occupied or the enemy army breaking off. If you fail to escape the siege, and then the enemy army breaks off for a while before returning and resuming the siege, you will get another chance to escape.
			At the end of a siege, the owner of the occupying army will get a chance to decide the fates of anyone captured within. Note that choosing to slaughter everyone present has been slightly altered compared to before. It no longer includes the ruler of the barony in the massacre, even if said ruler is present, and it causes somewhat harsher opinion penalties. The AI is currently blocked from committing massacres, but that functionality will be restored in a future update.
		Looting:
			During looting there are no defender events. It's assumed that rulers and their families are relatively (but not entirely) safe from the raiders. There are also no choices for attackers at the end of the siege; instead, anyone who was captured at the scene is automatically taken prisoner.
			The odds of being captured are low for rulers and anyone with a dynasty. They go up if you're lowborn, are a bishop of a religion different from the raiders, or are a woman and the raiders are Pagans or Zoroastrians.
			There are also a couple of new mechanics associated with looting. Non-tribal looters who capture a bishop of their own religion will usually get asked to release that bishop and refusing to do so will cost a small amount of piety; the AI will always choose to release. Additionally, any player who is non-tribal and either not Pagan or reformed Pagan will lose piety (and the Zealous trait!) if they loot temple holdings of their own faith.
		Other changes:
			Compared to the old system, there will be fewer prisoners taken overall, and much fewer when looting.
			All of these mechanics respect the In Hiding trait, along with all the pilgrimage traits. A character is also not counted as being present at a barony when they're a councilor on the job in the province.
			Most of the immediate trait gain or removal effects have been removed. There may still be consequences or rewards for behavior seen as especially notable, but they won't manifest immediately. (Obviously choosing to slaughter captured folks at the end of the siege is one of several exceptions.)
			Flavor text is now dynamically adjusted depending on many different circumstances.
			Numerous bugs with the old system are fixed or avoided altogether; the most important of which being that it's no longer possible to easily blitz the capital of the primary participant in your war and capture them; while it's still very much possible to win a war by capturing an enemy ruler in a siege, it's now considerably more rare.
	Merchant Republics:
		New customization decision *Rules for Merchant Republics*:
			Normally, republics are limited to a maximum of Limited Crown Authority. If the option to unlock laws is chosen, republics may raise crown authority like any feudal ruler. Likewise, they may become the target of factions to lower crown authority.
			Normally, republics are limited to standard claim CBs and the 3 republic CBs (Seize Trade Post, Seize City, Seize County). If the option to unlock CBs is chosen, they may use any CB that they may use in vanilla.
			Rules can be changed after initial customization.
		Extended pagan CBs (Subjugation, Holy War, County Conquest, Tribal Invasion, etc.) and a few Muslim CBs (e.g., County Conquest) have been further restricted for merchant republics, unless the aforementioned customization option to unlock their CBs is used.
		The two main republic CBs (Seize City, Seize County) no longer require that the target be adjacent or within 2 seazones. Instead, they're restricted by a maximum map distance of 200. [For the curious, this corresponds to 200 pixels' distance on map/provinces.bmp]
		Muslim patricians / merchant republics can now use the Seize County CB on different-religion targets like all other republicans.
	Distribute Recently Acquired Land:
		FIX: Resolved OoS (source of a desync) when used in multiplayer.
		In singleplayer, per-province prompts are now more informative with regard to the province in question and relations to the potential existing characters to which you may grant it.
		In multiplayer, land distribution is now completely one-step, automatic. All recently-acquired provinces still in your demesne that aren't in your capital duchy will be granted, so make specific grants first.
		Only shows up as a high-priority decision (i.e., with an alert) when over demesne limit. Otherwise, it's still available in the decisions menu (without an alert), if you still want to use it.
		Duration of the 'Recently Acquired' modifier greatly lengthened to 4 months (from 2 weeks) to make it much more usable in multiplayer.
		In singleplayer, it now allows multiple rounds of province granting by remembering recently-acquired provinces which were skipped.
		Whenever possible, it will now automatically switch province capitals to match your character type (castles or cities).
		No longer shows your primary heir as a potential candidate for province granting if your succession law is gavelkind or elective gavelkind.
		Likewise, if you are a doge, your current heir (to the republic) is of your dynasty and not already landed, and the county in consideration for grant does not have a city capital, then they are blocked from the list of potential grant candidates.
	Dynamic CoA rules (for England, Aragon) should now take effect immediately upon reloading a savegame (rather than waiting 0-2 years for maintenance to correct the CoA)
	The Execute all Prisoners decision now only charges piety for executing prisoners who are not your religion and indicates in the tooltip which prisoners will cost you piety or give you the Kinslayer trait.
	The Ransom All Prisoners decision has been overhauled. It now features logic more closely resembling the in-game ransom button, so both the AI willingness to accept requests and the value of the ransom should be more accurate.
	The Exchange Prisoners decision has been removed due to its pointlessness; distant dynasty members everywhere weep for its loss.
	Added Suebi, Pictish, and Germanic castle culture buildings and updated Indian castle culture building to the PB/EMF model.
	Players now have access to several new diplomatic actions towards their prisoners: They can freely move their own prisoners between house arrest, a regular dungeon cell, or the oubliette. In addition, they can now request that a vassal transfer any prisoner who is a primary participant in the player's war. (AI still has their own prisoner transfer, but it works by event for greater efficiency.)
	Blinding, Castration, and Zun Judgment of prisoners are now diplomatic actions for players, reducing intrigue menu clutter
	Absolute Cognatic succession law can now be passed without enabling the global Gender Equality customization (simply requires prestige and progressive reform from Agnatic-Cognatic)
	Women can now fill any councillor position (except for Court Chaplain) if their employer's gender succession law is Absolute Cognatic
	Monthly prestige for Chancellors, Marshals, and Stewards doubled, Spymaster and Lord Spiritual almost-doubled (half the monthly prestige of the former group) -- one-time lump sum bonuses upon hire unchanged
	Councillor ambitions now properly abort whenever a character no longer meets the requirements for being hired for that particular councillor position
	AI will no longer take councillor ambitions unless the currently-employed councillor of that type has no more than 3 of the relevant skill points' advantage upon the hopeful AI character
	Making your special buddy, the AI, less of a pathological serial killer (and a better spy):
		In vanilla, the murder event which can trigger due to the Intrigue focus's 'Spy On' action has no AI weighting (intelligence) upon the decision to pursue murder. In EMF, the AI weighting of attempting murder has now been tied to logic very similar to traditional murder plot targeting, with some modifications to further reduce pathologies / wiping out whole families (will generally only attempt to kill when they actual stand to gain in terms of improving inheritance odds for themselves, children, etc.)
		AI with the Intrigue focus is smarter about using 'Spy On' to attempt to recruit faction members (now specifically targets those that aren't in the factions that they lead, rather than simply those that aren't in factions at all-- which was essentially nobody due to the Autonomy Faction containing virtually everyone)
		AI lieges with the Intrigue focus no longer tend to unnecessarily 'Spy On' Autonomy Faction members but instead focus upon conspiratorial factions only (which also reduces pesky serial killing further)
	Players must now be Bulgarian or Serbian to create the Bulgarian Empire
	FIX: Tribal shipyards now have the same number of tiers as feudal or merchant republic shipyards
	FIX: Error in standard Holy War CB that would cause it to sometimes be mysteriously unavailable due to, apparently, the Baqt Treaty being active
	FIX: Feudalized tribes will now have proper investiture law
	FIX: Restored retinue filter to several new Charlemagne retinues
	FIX: Feast, Summer Fair, and Hunt decisions should now work properly
	FIX: Upon Magyar settlement in the Carpathian Basin, baronies that don't yet exist (aren't built) are no longer granted to the ruler chosen to take their non-Russian provinces in the Steppes (usually the Pecheneg Khan)
	VANILLA FIX: Corrected typo in vanilla 00_plots.txt file


EMF 3.07 [2015-02-27]
	Feasts, hunts, etc. costs are proportional to income again (rather than flat rate of 25 gold)
	AI can no longer create custom kingdoms/empires (will reconsider if Paradox ever fixes so-called "k_dyn_XXXX" bugs/oversight)
	(EMF+SWMH) Base vassal limits raised to accomodate SWMH map/title differences (Duke +5, King +5, Emperor +10)
	AI can no longer successfully fabricate claims on a merchant republic's capital county (player already couldn't due to restrictions on where a chancellor may be placed, but AI is apparently ignoring the restriction due to a major engine bug)
	Pagan title CoA will now be based upon the ruling dynasty (like Muslims)
	AI will now pay the same prestige/maintenance cost as players when using the 'Raise Tribal Army' decision
	AI will now only use the 'Raise Tribal Army' decision when it's fighting a player (otherwise, it's better that the AI generally save its prestige to develop its holdings)
	FIX: Fixes for Seljuk Invasion of Anatolia -> Formation of Rum event chain and removal of Byzantine independence event chain (for Cilicia and Antioch, mostly), which was causing very strange behavior
	FIX: MAX_LEADERSHIP_TRAITS reduced to 2 (vanilla) due to a bug with the vanilla events for awarding them
	FIX: Bulgarian Empire title history fixed
	FIX: (EMF+SWMH) The Seljuks are again the emperors of Persia in the 1066 start (for a couple versions, they'd only held the Kingdom of Persia title)
	FIX: (EMF+SWMH) The HRE is again the de jure empire everywhere it should be after the New World Order customization decision is enacted. To restore it as such in existing NWO savegames on SWMH, invoke 'event emf_nwo.100' on the console. [Fix-up event will be removed in future versions.]
	VANILLA FIX: Duke tier or higher AI characters will no longer randomly convert to other religions when asked by friends
	VANILLA FIX: All vanilla event files with improper non-breaking-spaces instead of spaces have been fixed and overridden (44 event files). Should fix a lot of vanilla issues.
	MINOR: Issue with inheritance of loan and marriage decisions menu toggle state fixed
	MINOR: Invalid ai_ambition character modifier for the Sunni/Shia religions removed (was showing up as 'NONE: +5.00' in the religion tooltip)


EMF 3.06 [2015-02-08]
	[Scenario Customization Decision] New World Order
		Give the map a facelift in a myriad number of new ways at any start date with this powerful new customization decision.
		Dismantle the Christian empires (or just the HRE, or the Persian Empire, etc.) and add lots of new kingdoms within which to politick in its de jure kings mode.
		Or, shatter the world (or just a part of it) into independent counties or duchies and use [optional] rapid conquest CBs to etch your own New World Order.
		Invoke the decision multiple times in a row with different selections to terraform the map in more complex ways. Combine it with other customizations such as the day-1 'Convert to Merchant Republic' diplo-action, 'Feudalize Tribes,' or 'No CB Cooldowns.'
		Unless you choose otherwise, players always get preference over AI rulers for de jure duke/king selection.
		AI de jure duke / king random selection preference is first for current/previous de jure rulers (if the player so chooses), and whenever there was no preexisting de jure ruler, feudal > tribal > republic > theocracy.
		All affected rulers surrender all but their capital province to local province barons, even in de jure dukes / kings modes. However, when in de jure dukes / kings modes, starting rulers get strong, pressed claims on the counties that they surrendered.
		If an AI ruler's starting capital is not the province in their demesne with the most holdings, they will move their capital to their best demesne province before surrendering their extra counties. Player capitals are never automatically relocated.
		When in de jure kings mode on the VANILLA map, de jure duchies will be auto-distributed to vassals whose capital is a given duchy's de jure capital. [Avoids vassal limit bootstrapping issues.]
		When in de jure kings mode on the SWMH map, due to a major SWMH limitation, the above will be the case for some kingdoms (or selected duchies within them) but, otherwise, the remainder/all of the duchies in a kingdom will be given to their de jure king for manual distribution.
		NWO replaces Shattered Balance:
			The old "Rapid Conquest" CBs from Shattered Balance have been retrofitted (albeit lightly) and are now rid of a number of old bugs (e.g., no more usurpation of the Ecumenical Patriarchy, Papal State, or other weirdness).
			No more support for the "immortals" option (sorry! EMF must politely insist on your death-- as many times as possible!)
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Feudalize Tribes
		This scenario customization decision allows you to instantly feudalize all tribes.
		Also, it automatically builds a random but plausible distribution of additional castle, city, and temple holdings within the once-tribal provinces.
		Want a slice of what Russia or any other such now-tribal region used to be like in 1066 or 867, before the map changes due to Charlemagne? Here you go.
	*Dynamic Flags:*
		For certain titles, the CoA for the title will be automatically adjusted according to certain dynamic rules (currently based upon holder culture and dynasty)
		NOTE: Flags will only be updated immediately upon title inheritance, usurpation, creation, and on scenario startup. Otherwise, any other changes may take up to 2 years to be reflected.
		For the [Christian] Kingdom of England:
			If the holder is a de Normandie, Plantagenet, or Norman-cultured, the Plantagenet Lions will be used
			If the holder is Saxon-cultured, the Saxon Dragon will be used
			If none of the above, the Cross of St. George will be used
		For the Kingdom of Aragon:
			If the holder is a de Barcelona, the dynasty's classic heraldry will be used
			Otherwise, the default flag will be used
	Previously defunct decision to 'Bring Child Home' restored in the form of a same-named diplo-action & special action alert: Kids in the wrong court (but not prisoners)? Bring 'em home.
	(EMF+SWMH) Starting forces of the Normans, Saxons, and Norwegians in the Stamford Bridge start rebalanced
	When negotiating to drop decadence ("straighten-up"), Ibadi/Kharijite targets now have a choice to join the Haruriyyah holy order like Shia/Sunni muslims do (vanilla omission)
	Magyars no longer spawn additional event troops when they take the decision 'Create Hungary'
	Magyar settlement event upon taking the decision 'Create Hungary' rewritten to be more robust and always find an appropriate ruler(s) to take the old Steppe holdings of the Magyars
	SPECIAL_TROOPS_GRAPHICAL_FACTOR reduced to 4 from 20; players should see a lot fewer camels and horse archers on the map (and will see Byzantine Cataphract models with the right DLC)
	Decision menu toggle state is now inherited upon player character death rather than resetting for each new character
	'Conscript Merchant Ships' decision no longer shows at top of decisions menu unless actually at war
	AI tribals can now also use 'Raise Tribal Army' decision (spend prestige for a fixed-size mercenary unit while at war)
	*Distribute Recently Acquired Land:*
		As options for a county grant, decision no longer shows prisoners that are otherwise "best-fit" characters
		Localisation of "best-fit" character options now includes their name (as well as their clickable portrait) and no longer suggests they're from your court (might be a vassal)
	Higher-skilled chancellors no longer have a chance to fabricate a duchy claim if the targeted duchy is held by a merchant republic and it's their capital duchy
	Natural death chances at ages 60-100 are now higher
	Bishops now pay only 5% of their normal tax to an anti-pope if they are loyal to him rather than their liege (down from 10%, which is the amount the real Pope receives)
	DOW_AGGRESSION_FACTOR raised to 0.6 from vanilla 0.5; the AI will be 20% more likely than vanilla to wage war when it has sufficient conditions (a CB, adequate troop ratio, etc.)
	FIX: Rulers should no longer be converting to Judaism due to courtiers
	FIX: Decision to 'Go on Hajj' for Muslims now works without the WoL theology focus
	FIX: Isis can no longer be seduced
	VANILLA FIX: Invalid Papacy claims (generated due to papal succession bug) cleared routinely to prevent wanton antipapacies
	VANILLA FIX: 'Antiking Faction' CB and 'Depose Antipope' CB now have a workaround for the vanilla bug that's been rendering them useless since patch 2.3
	VANILLA FIX: Removed 3 invalid vanilla event references from on_actions (could potentially cause random behavior, although none has been observed)


EMF 3.05 [2015-01-24]
	VANILLA FIX: When using the 'Business' focus, no longer will rulers open up trade routes with landless characters such as Isis or rulers such as the Pope if, e.g., Muslim


EMF 3.04 [2015-01-23]
	Distribute Recently Acquired Land: Now shows clickable portraits for the [up to] two "best-fit" characters options for title distribution in its per-province prompt
	EMF no longer uses any title history from Project Balance
	Jewish councillor events now include an option to refuse and, if accepted, give appropriate sympathy traits and opinion modifiers so that the Jewish characters are more useful as councillors
	Great Goddess Isis will no longer pick a WoL focus
	Don't even think about 'pollinating' Isis
	FIX: There should no longer be any issues with certain cultures using the wrong unit models when using either the vanilla or SWMH map (!)
	FIX: Great Goddess Isis's sexy new custom portrait is now actually working (again, thanks to Crakdtoothgrin for the portrait art!)
	FIX: Magyar "settlement" event should now properly work


EMF 3.03 [2015-01-16]
	Updated for CKII v2.3.2
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Convert to Merchant Republic
		This scenario customization decision converts your feudal ruler into the Doge of a new, independent, and optionally de jure kingdom-tier merchant republic.
		The 4 rival patrician families will be auto-generated by the game once you unpause. Similarly, note that you also cannot build trade posts until immediately after unpausing the game (day 2).
		Cool extra, related feature: there is now a special 'Convert to Merchant Republic' diplo-action available upon essentially any coastal feudal ruler (but only before unpausing the game). With this diplo-action, you can create AI merchant republics-- and still choose whether they're de jure kingdom-tier or simple duke-tier-- wherever you damn well please all over the map.
	[Scenario Customization Decision] No CB Cooldowns
		You may now choose whether to disable all CB "cooldowns" (for all rulers) before unpausing via the decisions menu (affects holy war, county conquest, republics, subjugation, tribal invasion, etc.)
		Can be enacted at any time but is currently irreversible once enacted
	*More Crown Authority, More Money*
		All non-default increments of crown authority laws now grant an additional +2.5% feudal, city, and clergy tax. This can add up very quickly, especially for feudal tax in large realms.
		If you can set legal precedent in favor of the crown on any subject (protected inheritance, internal king's peace, etc.), it is reasonable to expect that the same crown would be able to require / demand slightly higher taxes, ceteris paribus. Naturally, raising crown authority also reduces vassal opinion and may put you at risk of revolts (just as always), so the pay-off isn't fundamental.
		This makes pursuing centralization of power with the crown a more lucrative business, if nothing else. While each crown law has always had its strategic benefits, it has never been more clear that centralization of power with the crown is, in essence, *theoretically* good for the crown.
		Now perhaps you can finally afford those shiny retinues in order to crush the consequent rebellions of disempowered nobles! [ More work to be done soon on better rebellions, though! ]
	*Distribute Recently Acquired Land*
		Decision now also works for counties acquired through inheritance
		Cosmetic improvements (some automatically-generated tooltips were misleading, and a [wrong] character portrait was shown in the main province-prompt event under certain conditions)
		Once decision is taken, it will now prompt for the full set of recently-acquired counties and no longer stop once your character is no longer over their demesne limit. Simply choose not to grant what you want to keep, and remember, even if it's recently-acquired, you'll never be prompted about anything in your capital duchy.
		Now also searches your court for up to 2 best-fit candidates for each province and allows the option to select one of these instead of a new, random character when prompting for each province
		Now applies the proper Indian caste trait to newly-created characters, if relevant
		Newly-created characters will have a stewardship education rather than a fully-random education
		Vanilla's 'Ask For Help Managing Titles' decision is now disabled unless your chancellor is another player; EMF's decision is safer and more reliable
	*Ruler Designer Unlocked*
		There is now no need to use external mods such as "Ruler Designer Unlocked!" with EMF (no age costs).
		You can add whatever traits to your character that you please and set whatever character properties that you like. Ruler-design responsibly, *ahem*.
		You may customize your age exactly from 16-79 with any combination of the 6 age customizer traits in the Ruler Designer (+1 year, +2 years, +4 years, ..., +32 years). These "age traits" are removed from your character within a few days of unpausing your game.
	Great Goddess Isis of Duat now has her very own sexy portrait set and a proper Ancient Egyptian religion icon (portrait art thanks to Crakdtoothgrin!)
	AI rulers won't use de jure county claims, de jure duchy claims, or third-party de jure county claims to conquer AI merchant republics' capitals unless they are themselves another merchant republic and not part of the same greater realm
	AI decision to seduce as well as tendency to pick the seduction focus has been yet further nerfed
	When using the Pagan Subjugation CB, it is now only necessary to share a border with the enemy in the target kingdom-- not to actually be landed within the target kingdom too (plus some other changes)
	Independence Faction is less likely to jump the gun on ultimatums at relatively low faction power ratios
	[Ambition] Disabled Find Hobby ambition when Way of Life DLC is active; Find Hobby is not currently compatible with the Way of Life lifestyle trait distribution method
	OPTIMIZED: Dynamic levy efficiency laws are now only applied to a ruler's primary title rather than all primary-tier titles and should automatically copy whenever their primary title changes (plus other optimizations)
	OPTIMIZED/FIXED: AI no longer uses employment decisions to randomly spawn courtiers of various types, as in vanilla-- far fewer random courtiers will be spawned and may fix a stability issue
	FIX: Religious Reconquest now, like standard Holy War, allows Reformed Norse to wage war over sea zones
	FIX: Bulgarian Empire title creation conditions now consistent with other empire titles (minimum realm size of 120)
	FIX: AI Lucky Rulers are no longer subject to trait restrictions when attempting to use the Pagan Subjugation CB _outside_ their capital de jure kingdom (same restrictions as players)
	FIX: The Autonomy Faction's remove_internal_peace CB had 3 on_add sections (duplicate); it now has one, as it should
	MINOR: Vassal AIs must be king-tier or higher to fabricate claims outside their realm; however, vassal duke AIs may do so as well if the target realm's top liege is a player (like previously)
	MINOR: All councillor ambitions use expectation_of_liege = yes to hint the AI


EMF 3.02 [2014-12-23]
	Seduction:
		Optimization of the seduction focus's CPU overhead (reduced the amount of conditions that need to be constantly evaluated by any given AI considering other AIs for seduction)
		If the target is chaste, you cannot seduce them if they're married or already have a lover
		AI will not seduce zealous, non-pagan married women-- thanks to cybrxkhan's STOP (Stop The Orgy, Please!) mini-mod for this idea in particular (the rest of STOP's rules are now covered by EMF too, though with some differences)
		AI is now interested in targets that have the *cough* 'Well-Endowed' (fertile) trait from VIET (worth half as much as Attractive targets); if target has both traits, the weighting stacks additively
		AI won't pick the seduction _focus_ if craven
		If AI already has at least one lover, it must be lustful to pick the seduction _focus_
		If AI has at least 3 lovers, it will never pick the seduction _focus_ (and cancel it once cancellation is allowed, if already picked)
		AI base rate of seduction reduced by approx. 3-fold
		Unless AI is lustful, they will not seduce anyone if they already have a lover
		AI will never seduce if they become infirm after focus selection
		AI will not seduce targets that are celibate, eunuchs, or infirm
		AI will not seduce if the target has a negative VIET congenital trait that makes them unattractive (e.g., wrymouth); vanilla already does this for its relevant negative congenital traits
		AI will be 1/3 as interested in seducing any given target for each additional lover that they already have (multiplicative stacking)
	Focus can be changed once every 4 years rather than 5 now
	Various minor defines tweaks
	FIX: Rebel leaders should now be able to raise levies of fellow revolters
	MINOR: Decision 'Found a Merchant Republic' now converts the capital _holding_ of the tribe to a city rather than converting the capital _province_ to a republic (should be equivalent, but map issues can affect this)


EMF 3.01 [2014-12-19]
	New 'Bless With Luck' and 'Remove Luck' diplo-actions for Lucky Ruler assignment now take into account whether you're at war with the target character
	Province religious conversion via councillors is now significantly less rapid
	Special province religious conversion rules for Rum, coastal Turks, and inland Turks made specific to the Anatolian / Byzantine / Rumite geopolitical situation rather than applying everywhere
	Dynamic levy efficiency (dynlevy):
		For players, efficiency changes are now instantaneously reflected by changes in realm_size (updates while still paused; no longer need to wait 1 game day to see changes)
		For AI, dynamic levy efficiency law recalculations are now no longer triggered within a day of any title transfer and instead more efficiently recalculated in batch on a periodic pulse
	EMF now uses vanilla merchant republics
		Gotland, the Hansa, and Amalfi return. The other custom republics, with the exception of those in the Indian Ocean, were largely no longer functional after patch 2.2 (Charlemagne) in any case.
		Rather than add more custom merchant republics statically, a scenario customization decision is being considered to enable dynamic merchant republic creation/conversion in-game wherever desired (coastal only).
		Nevertheless, more custom merchant republics may still be added yet.
	Succession laws:
		Forced the HRE to stick with feudal elective succession for AI emperors (though succession law factions can still form and force a change)
		Opinion modifiers further tweaked for the available feudal succession types to improve balance and worthwhile strategic diversity. Notable changes:
			Regular gavelkind is now the most attractive from a vassal- and dynasty-opinion standpoint (and its +30% demesne bonus).
			Primogeniture is not without its sacrifices.
			Seniority is now significantly more viable than previously. Consider trying this some time if you haven't, especially if you're breaking out of a tribal or gavelkind situation with many disparate titles held by separate dynasty members.
			Feudal elective no longer awards vassal opinion, as this is frankly a nonsensical CK2 tradition. If de jure elector vassals were an opinion class that could be targeted by law, then it could make sense to award [i]only them[/i] opinion. However, this is not possible, and even so, the case for any bonus is still weak for a feudal elective title, a title whose consitituent de jure electoral titles' consensus upon succession is fundamentally more legitimate than all hereditary claim to it. [If anything, elective lieges ought to think slightly higher of their de jure elector vassals (the reverse).]
				Expect more changes regarding feudal elective in the future to reduce its potential for abuse and more appropriately model the legal/philosophical implications of such a law.
		Removed some vestigial references to the believed-no-longer-necessary 'Decentralized HRE' law in succession law requirements


EMF 3.0 [2014-12-18]
	Compatible with CKII v2.3 (Way of Life); not backwards-compatible with older versions of CKII
	Title-specic malus in the form of the 'Decentralized HRE' law experimentally removed; it should no longer be necessary due to more general balancing mechanic improvements in this version
	AI Lucky Rulers:
		Now unencumbered by any trait restrictions in all CBs, just like players
		Bless With Luck: One can now assign Lucky Ruler status to a specific ruler via this new diplomacy action (regardless of whether the Lucky Rulers scenario customization decision was taken, so luck can now be precisely assigned)
		Remove Luck: Having second thoughts? You can always remove Lucky Ruler status at will with this new diplomacy action.
	Muslim County Conquest: AI restrictions for usage when an inter-religion war greatly lessened (player usage unaffected)
	Warrior/Fighter traits now factor into WoL personal duel system and their bonuses were tweaked a bit
	Defines (variables which factor into various base game formulae) changes:
		Holding levy sizes now half as influenced by the martial stat of the particular holding owner (HOLDING_LEVY_SIZE_OWNER_MARTIAL_MULT = 0.75, HOLDING_LEVY_SIZE_OWNER_MARTIAL_BASE = 0.025)
		Nobles are more likely to choose to personally command their soldiers when a liege raises their levies (OPINION_WHEN_MARSHAL_INSTEAD_OF_SELF = 0)
		Vassals will no longer provide any liege levies at all when their liege opinion is below -50 (MIN_LEVY_RAISE_OPINION_THRESHOLD = -50)
		Vassals will provide a minimum of 25% of their liege levy obligation at the new -50 liege opinion threshold for levies (with linear scaling above the threshold). E.g., -100 to -49 opinion nets 0% levies, -50 opinion nets 25% levies, 0 opinion nets 50% levies, 25 opinion nets 62.5% levies, 50 opinion nets 75% levies, and so on (MIN_LEVIES_ABOVE_OPINION_THRESHOLD = 0.25)
		When unloading troops (e.g., raiders) from a galley, it now takes twice as long as previously, so it's now the same as vanilla (ARMY_UNLOAD_MOVE_COST = 20.0)
		When loading troops (e.g., raiders) back into galleys (when the ships are not in port), it now takes twice as long as it did for them to unload (ARMY_LOAD_MOVE_COST = 40.0)
		Capturing the heir of your enemy during a war is now "only" worth 30% warscore instead of 50% (CAPTURED_HEIR_WAR_SCORE = 30.0)
		While levy reinforce rates are the same (4%/yr base), vassals' reinforcement of their liege levy contribution reinforces 25% more slowly than their personal levy (LIEGE_LEVY_REINF_RATE = 0.03)
		Vassals pay 20% less for levy maintenance when the levies are raised by a liege rather than the vassal personally (LIEGE_LEVY_COST_MULTIPLIER = 0.8)
		Viceroys (including minor/duke viceroys) provide 20% less liege levies, ceteris paribus-- now the same as vanilla (LIEGE_LEVY_VICE_ROYALTY_MULTIPLIER = 0.8)
		During civil wars, the revolt leader will be able to raise more troops than normal from his fellow revolters (REBEL_LEADER_MINIMUM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1.25)
		More severe penalties to liege levy contributions depending upon how far they are away from the liege's capital. Strict distance is not used for these penalties; instead, "concentric rings" of decreasingly-concentrated de jure territory tiers with respect to the liege's capital county are used. EMF was (and still is) much less severe in these penalties than vanilla because of its additional 'dynamic levies' (or, 'dynlevy') mechanic which also scales down effective liege levies with realm size. However, some adjustments were in order to better achieve EMF's goals:
			CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1 (was 1.15)
			CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.8 (was 0.9)
			CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.5 (was 0.8)
			OUTSIDE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.5 (was 0.7, now no extra penalty for your capital being in an area of the map with no de jure empire-- also just a lot less arbitrary)
		Weakened medium-to-large lieges' levy potential when spreading development over their entire capital duchy rather than concentrating on their capital county; there are still major levy bonuses for capital county, now neither bonus nor penalty for capital duchy, and appropriately-varying penalties elsewhere (CAPITAL_DUCHY_LEVY_MULT = 1-- was 1.25, CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1-- was 1.15)
		Some strategic notes:
			One still has every incentive to completely control their capital duchy (i.e., all province capitals) in order to maximize tax income due to more vassal barons. If your capital county has a lot of capacity and your demesne limit is scarce, the trade-off between maximum taxes (spread yourself over duchy) and levies (pump capital full of castles) is your choice to make. Also consider that retinues are very expensive but have obvious military advantages over levies.
			Keep in mind that the aforementioned, dramatic capital county levy bonuses (as well as the de jure tier liege levy penalties) apply to EVERY ruler-- not just you; therefore, it is extremely beneficial to total realm levy power to maximize the demesne efficiency of all your vassals by ideally limiting every ruler in your realm to a single county (regardless of tier).
			Viking raiding parties now face more serious risks, as they cannot instantly escape the moment you send an army their way. When raiding as a Viking, you're going to need to use more realistic tactics and target selection to plunder and pillage with the best.
			Capital selection matters a lot. Don't be afraid to move your capital. Unless you happen to start with an ideal capital, you should probably move your court at least once. In some areas of the map or upon major conquests/inheritances, it may be beneficial to do so a number of times. Remember, the de jure setup around the capital is critical-- not just the province and encompassing duchy.
			Be more wary of overextending your realm territorially. Upon reaching monumental sizes, something to consider would be spinning-off independent kingdoms that will aid you more efficiently in war.
	FIX: Automatic empire disintegration should no longer create titular kingdoms when searching for a valid king-level title for the emperor upon which to fallback
	FIX: Pagan holy war now costs only 200 piety the first time and then 300 piety thereafter (was costing 500 piety instead)
	FIX: You may now properly press third-party (for a vassal) de jure claims on counties and baronies against different-religion holy orders
	FIX: Peace pledge ambition is now properly enforced by third-party claim CBs (cannot even attempt to press de jure claims or regular claims for a subject character while peace pledge is active)
	MINOR: AI now actually always prefers to 'Press All Claims' rather than press them individually
	MINOR: Eliminated needless exceptions for Byzantium & Roman Empire from all 5 de jure claim CBs' tooltips


EMF 2.06 [2014-12-07]
	Cleaned-up tooltips for 'Adopt Feudalism,' 'Found a Merchant Republic,' and all laws which are unlocked by technology (visual improvement, less redundant)
	Magyar starting troops/commanders boosted so that they can actually win their 867 invasion of Pannonia/Hungary (has been impossible since patch 2.2)
	If startinIg at a bookmark in which Hagia Sophia is controlled by a Catholic, it will be automatically granted to the Ecumenical Patriarch to avoid early mending of the Catholic Schism
	EMF 2.05's hack to improve AI raid targeting by enabling prepared invasions for all pagans has been reverted (caused more issues than it addressed)


EMF 2.05 [NO OFFICIAL RELEASE]
	Maintenance event which kills useless, auto-spawned courtiers (no claims, no skills, etc.) moved from yearly pulse to 5-yearly pulse
		Cuts down on the dead character count as the campaign progresses, because they quickly respawn (optimization)
	Succession law opinion modifiers and requirements reworked to provide more strategy and clarity while also being more robust
	Raiding:
		Looting is again allowed for the reformed version of pagan religions. If players want to do it, so be it.
		Due to a bug in CKII 2.1.1 regarding AI raid targeting, all pagan religions capable of raiding have prepared invasions temporarily enabled. If non-Norse, don't expect it to work, but it's necessary to make the AI properly raid at this time. Additionally, note that this will cause coastal, non-Norse pagans to also raid via boat from time to time, although they won't be able to navigate rivers. Please refrain from reporting this as a bug; it is a hack to fix raiding for the AI in Charlemagne that will hopefully be removed soon.
	AI Lucky Rulers:
		Now much more likely to join and create independence factions
		Now able to use the 'Bid For Independence CB' against AI lieges even when a de jure vassal and regardless of their traits
		Can fabricate minor claims (via chancellor-- not plots) a bit faster
	Automatic Empire Disintegration:
		FIX: 2.04's change which prevented automatic disintegration for the first 30 years of any campaign should now work properly
		As a special case, the HRE now requires a 150 realm_size minimum after the year 1100 (rather than 100 realm_size)
	AI 'Conqueror' trait now has a pretty icon
	Independence faction now just a bit more rowdy in the face of a competing claimant faction (or the possibility of one)
	Decadence revolts can now kick in at 60% decadence, are much more likely to happen at higher levels, and are more dangerous
	Norse conversion to Catholicism now much more likely after 930, also reversed a related major vanilla bug with Norse conversion likelihood
	FIX: Haruriyyah holy order now comes with enough galleys to transport itself (vanilla bug)


EMF 2.04 [2014-11-19]
	Full CKII v2.2.1 compatibility
	Reformed pagan religions can no longer raid unless tribal
		Otherwise, raiding's just plain overpowered and against the spirit of reformation, especially with same-religion raiding in CM.
		Note that Reformed Norse can still jet through major river systems as they please.
	Automatic Empire Disintegration:
		Rump / broken empires are now exempt from automatic disintegration for the first 30 years of any campaign.
		Bulgarian Empire will now have a chance to survive and thrive.
		Mongol Empire (see the dedicated bookmark-- not the usual Mongols) will now have time to establish itself.
		For Latin Empire starts, Byzantium will have three long decades to reclaim Constantinople before losing empire-tier status.
	A new 'Conqueror' trait is now automatically applied to AI horde invaders to ensure that plunder and rampage fills their hearts
		Only affects AI disposition (no trait bonuses).
		Automatically removed when they convert to a less aggressive religion (except for the Timurids) or become incapable.
		Fear the Mongols / Timurids / Aztecs! Fear!
	AI Lucky Rulers now more aggressively pursue what they want as well as independence if vassal to another lord (no new bonuses)
	Cutting down on needless vanilla popups by converting them to notification events which appear in high-priority messages tab instead
		Job: Marshal: Levy reinforcements letter event converted (and duration of modifier doubled to two years)
		Job: Lord Spiritual: Indirect province religious conversion (done by a vassal's lord spiritual) letter event converted
	Muslim County Conquest, when a holy a war, now properly allows neighbors of the same religion of the defender to join the war
	Default Obligations/Focus demesne laws can/will now always be passed if no other laws in their slider group are set
		Prevents "locked law" issues which can occur when, e.g., usurping a higher-tier Muslim title as a non-Muslim or vice versa
	The effects of province conversion on religious authority have been dramatically decreased
		The prior religion (the one which was converted) no longer receives a negative RA hit upon conversion.
		The new religion (the one to which the province converted) only receives 1% RA for 5 years rather than 20 years.
		Hopefully, this better balances religious authority in the 1066 start while still reflecting an authority boost from conversion


EMF 2.03
	Full CKII v2.2.0.4 beta branch support and compatch
		No longer works without opting into the CKII beta branch on Steam (2.2's initial release was broken)
	Unreformed pagans may now adopt feudalism or republicanism (tribal opinion malus still applies, though)
	De jure empires now require a minimum realm_size (number of holdings in realm) of 120 to create
	Custom empires still require 180 realm_size, but if you you hold 3+ kingdom titles, then only 120 realm_size is required
	Technology tooltips for unlocking decisions/laws now properly shown (underlying issue fixed in recent beta patch)
	Added Lombard and Visigothic cultural combat tactics
	(Vanilla Map) Major adjustment to de jure structure of Byzantium with new campaigns
	VANILLA FIX: Closed loopholes on merchant republic Doges passing seniority succession on their primary title
	(EMF+SWMH) FIX: A few recent defines.lua changes were out of sync with the main version
	FIX: Holy war was costing more piety than advertised


EMF 2.02
	VANILLA FIX: Workaround for all laws/decisions enabled by technology not being usable regardless of tech level
		'Adopt Republicanism' requires Trade Practices level 1
		'Adopt Feudalism' requires Noble Customs level 1
		'King Viceroys' requires Legalism level 4
		'Duke Viceroys' requires Legalism level 8 (unless playing the ERE or 'Imperial Administration' has been enacted)
		Centralization slider levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 require Legalism levels 1, 2, 3, and 5, respectively
		'Imperial Administration' requires Majesty level 5


EMF 2.01
	First feature-complete release for Charlemagne
	CKII v2.2 (Charlemagne) Compatibility Patch Continued:
		Full CKII v2.2.0.2 beta branch support and compatch
		Full CKII v2.2.0.1 beta branch support and compatch
		FIX: Minor province settlement graphics issue
		FIX: Syntax error in a presently unused trait definition
		FIX: INTER_MUSLIM_WAR_MONTHLY_PIETY_COST = 1 (was accidentally doubled in compatch)
	(Vanilla Map) Adopted fresh landed_titles (de jure structure and title definitions) from vanilla (with modifications)
	Imperial Administration can now be unlocked with near-maximum crown authority (but the ERE gets it for free)
	When forming a new empire, King's Peace laws are automatically translated into Emperor's Peace
	Children will now have a chance to express some 'nature' (vs. 'nurture') personality traits automatically at a young age.
		The trait selection is strongly influenced by both the traits of the father and the mother-- not by the guardian.
		Mom's personality traits actually matter to your kids' future now, so marry wisely.
		Should see fewer annoying vanilla ward events and a more plausible personality development process rather than the usual vanilla breeding program.
	Ibadi holy order rebalanced to fit EMF's holy order maintenance/size standards.
		They get galleys enough to transport themselves and are composed of archers, light cavalry, and camel cavalry.
		Their maintenance-normalized size is double that of either of the 2 Sunni or Shiite holy orders, because there is no second Ibadi holy order.
		The Haruriyyah also now simply require that Muslim jihads have been unlocked to form.
	Combat tactics and special_troops upgrade
		Camel cavalry should now be a lot more effective in combat than previously.
		FIX: Vanilla's special_troops (elephants, camel_cavalry, and horse_archers) maintenance and skirmish/melee/pursuit attack/defense values reverted to intentional, pre-2.2 values.
	Province religion conversion now affects religious authority (+1% per province converted, -1% per province led astray-- heresy appearance doesn't count)
	Provinces of different culture, culture_group, religion, or religion_group now cause small local_revolt_risk in addition to their numerous other maluses
	Councillors again lift Fog of War when assigned; multiplayer exploit no longer an issue due to the inability to instantly reassign councillors (now requires min. 14 days)
	Sieges take 20% less time to complete, ceteris paribus.
	Battles against religious enemies yield less piety (-33%).
	Laws:
		Slightly more forgiving vassal opinion modifiers for all Obligations slider increments (+2 opinion)
		Fresh succession law implementation, simpler approach than PB to requirements for passing these laws
		FIX: For a Decentralized HRE or an ERE which hasn't even partially reformed its Themes System, Obligations law sliders cannot be raised
		FIX: Patricians now always have access to the Obligations/Focus sliders.
	MAJOR: Countless other undocumented, though *usually* relatively small, changes.


EMF 2.0
	Updated to CKII 2.2 and added support for all of the Charlemagne (CM) DLC content
	[Decadence] As promised, with the advent of CM, decadence has returned! Woe!
	[Decadence] Drunkard trait no longer treated as if it were charitable or diligent trait (vanilla bugs)
	In approval of 2.2's changes, EMF and vanilla now have an identical retinue model
		Cost is a bit higher than previously, although it's very close in nature to the prior EMF model
	AI prisoners will essentially never request better accomodations if you're at war
	Spymaster 'Study Technology' job action now fires less frequently and doesn't scale as well with spymaster intrigue skill
	Crusades now unlock if either the province owner OR his top liege aren't Christian for Braunschweig, Cologne, Paris, Toulouse, and Provence
	Rulers less likely to declare independence from their religious head if the religion has at least 40% authority
	Research points 'ahead penalty' raised to 40% per level beyond ideal year (previously 30%)
	Children are now only inherently liked by +10 opinion (except when they're a liege) rather than +15 opinion
	While doing a sweep for consistency and completeness for the 2.2 patch:
		The Anti-King Faction should now be prioritized in realms where an antipope is installed
		'Coastal County Republic' CB is now open to Muslims if the defender is also a Muslim
		'Coastal County Republic' CB may now only be used upon provinces that are adjacent or up to 2 sea zones away from the attacker
		'Duchy Adventure' CB toned-down a bit (minor)
		Can no longer ask to join a war being waged with the 'Pagan County Conquest' CB
		When subjugating rulers directly, the 'Tribal Invasion' CB now appropriately applies 'Subjugated' or 'Subjugated by Same Religion' opinion modifiers
		AI behavioral guidelines added to many CBs to improve AI war declaration plausibility
		FIX: Though it should have been released with Rajas of India, one may now wage war with the 'Buddhist Holy War' CB
		FIX: Pressing another's claim now always earns the correct opinion modifier (not de jure claims, which were fine-- personal claims)
		FIX: Claimant faction wars or otherwise pressing a third party's claim on your liege now properly respects the cooldown on [forced] loss of Crown Authority
		FIX: Merchant Republic AIs should now use their CBs more effectively
		FIX: Duke- or higher-tier vassals can choose independence after a successful tribal invasion (yep, decadence invasions are back for now)
		FIX: A number of achievements that were previously not fulfilled when their conditions were met are now properly fulfilled [NOTE: We still don't encourage Ironman]
	Due to a bug that breaks triggered modifiers in patch 2.2:
		The ERE's 'Disorganized' triggered modifier that lasts from 1066-1081 no longer exists (non-critical malus to army morale and morale recovery rate)
		Decentralized HRE and Themes System laws have been refactored as demesne laws rather than crown laws (superior approach, so net win)
	FIX: Weather module would sometimes fail to apply or regionally spread a province modifier for Heavy Rains


EMF 1.03 [final version for CKII 2.1.6]
	(EMF+SWMH) Empire disintegration, for empires not dependent upon Constantinople, kicks in at the same realm size minimum as for the vanilla map (100 holdings)
	FIX: Temporary revolt title dynamic levy laws now properly adjusted for faction size upon third-party claimant faction war declaration and immediately cleaned-up after the war (like all other types of faction revolts)
	FIX: 'De Jure County Claim' CBs for counties already covered by a valid 'De Jure Duchy Claim' CB are no longer listed, as previously intended (minor)
	FIX: Clarified requirements for attacking holy orders w/ SoA enabled for the ERE in third-party de jure claim CBs (minor)
	FIX: Third-party CBs (e.g., pressing someone else's claim) should now properly fulfill the 'Win a War' ambition


EMF 1.02
	Culture technology has been partially reset to vanilla: Noble Customs, Popular Customs, and Religious Customs again grant 2 opinion points per level rather than 1
	Military tweaks:
		RETINUE_FROM_REALMSIZE = 4.0 (-33%, vast majority of retinue cap comes from developing your demesne holdings anyway, so this is minor)
		RETINUE_REINFORCE_RATE = 0.03 (25% slower to reinforce, and this now properly makes them slower to reinforce than levies while at peace)
		COMMAND_MODIFIER_MARTIAL_MULTIPLIER = 0.05 (-33%, return to vanilla, incredibly high martial will no longer stack so strongly with leadership command modifiers)
	Research points 'ahead penalty' raised to 30% per level beyond ideal year (previously only 20%)
	Looting (actually completing sieges while raiding) is now considerably less profitable (raiding itself remains the same):
		LOOT_TAX_MULTIPLIER = 1.0 (-50% base gold derived from tax income of holdings)
		LOOT_BUILDING_MULTIPLIER = 0.015 (-25% extra gold derived from total cost of all buildings in holding)
	New decision: Distribute Newly Acquired Lands. Automatically distribute recently-acquired land, until you're no longer above your demesne limit
		Provinces remain marked 'recently acquired' for 0.5-1.5 months; it is intended to be used while paused after a war, but pausing is optional.
		All conquests and grants of provinces to you are included in the mechanic.
		It will never distribute counties from your capital duchy, even if recently-acquired.
		Aside from also giving new random counts (1 per province) any baronies that you may have also conquered inside their new county (so that they may, in turn, grant the baronies to the appropriate types of characters-- maximizing opinion bonuses due to grants for all), the process always stops once you're no longer above your demesne limit.
		For every province being considered for auto-distribution, you will be explicitly prompted regarding the province first so that you may easily keep any choice provinces.
		TIP: Manually grant recently-acquired land to dynasty members or favorite vassals before taking the decision to neatly get rid of the rest.
	New CB: 'De Jure Duchy Claim.' Like 'De Jure County Claim' and 'De Jure Barony Claim' but at the duchy level. Usage:
		You must hold the de jure empire or kingdom of the duchy.
		If you're a King and not an Emperor, then you must also have passed either the Internal or Full King's Peace in your primary title.
		The defender must have at least two counties within the duchy (otherwise, 'De Jure County Claim' can be used).
		If it's possible to use this CB instead of multiple 'De Jure County Claim' wars in the same duchy, those 'De Jure County Claim' CBs will no longer be listed.
		In the CB list, these will simply be listed as 'De Jure Claim on <TITLE>', just as it is with 'De Jure County Claim,' so pay attention to the titles involved.
	New mechanic: Automatic Empire Disintegration.
		Any empire that either drops below a certain realm size or, in the case of Byzantium and the Latin Empire, loses control of Constantinople will now automatically be forfeit.
		If the emperor lacks any other empire or kingdom titles at time of forfeiture, EMF will search for an appropriate, de jure kingdom title (one which has no holder and passes the "51% rule" for provinces controlled within the kingdom) and grant it to the emperor. This prevents the Emperor from losing all his duke vassals when the empire title is destroyed.
		For empires unrelated to Constantinople, the realm size threshold for empire disintegration is <150 holdings on the SWMH map and <100 holdings on the vanilla map.
	All children are now inherently more liked by all characters (+15 opinion)-- except for direct vassals, should they be a child ruler
		Ergo, it is now more difficult for players in foreign courts to gather enough plot power to murder entire dynasties without a hitch.
	De jure barony claim CBs now have a truce length of only 2 years (rather than 10)
		No longer will clean-up of a few stray baronies take decades.
	Vast majority of CBs have been modified so that the AI prefers player targets to AI targets, all else being equal.
		If the AI has already determined a player is a valid and worthwhile target (i.e., thinks it might win) and must choose between the player and another equally terrifying, qualifying AI upon which to declare war, it will choose to declare war on the player. This is a rare situation.
		In practice, this will only make things significantly more difficult in the upcoming, optional Hardcore Mode, but the AI could still prove more aggressive against you than previously. Feel the Fear.
	50% increase in intrigue-scaled plot discovery chance when using spymaster's 'Scheme' job action
	Disabled redundant plot discovery via event for 'Scheme' job action and associated assassinations / thugs / mobs killing spymaster
	Councillors no longer lift fog-of-war due to multiplayer exploitation
	Personality trait restrictions removed from player for Become King ambition
	All crown laws now no longer have trait restrictions (succession type, vassal opinions, prestige, and other factors still matter)
	Great Goddess Isis now has sharper teeth
	(Lucky Rulers) Lucky liege levy law bonuses nerfed to 3/5 prior, vassal_opinion nerfed to 3/5 prior
	(EMF+SWMH) The de jure King of Ireland title now destroyed upon scenario startup, making all the Irish minors peers (de jure title still exists)
	FIX: Ambition to lower decadence disabled until Charlemagne
	FIX: (Lucky Rulers) Lucky trait inheritance now works while co-installed with VIET Events
	FIX: Ambition Fulfilled / Fulfilled Marriage Wish / Generous Relative opinions granted by councillor/other ambitions (vanilla bug)


EMF 1.01
	FIX: Imperial Reconquest CB no longer has 'Select valid Casus Belli' issue
	Religious Reconquest CB can now be used on Rum (or anyone that holds Rum) at all
	Holy War, Religious Reconquest, and Special Holy War CBs can now be used on a recently-formed Rum or Crusader State
	Imperial Reconquest CB no longer requires waiting 15 years after Rum forms or after scenario start if Rum is already formed at the scenario start
	Disabled vanilla "trait-shedding" events, which randomly remove a personality trait if you have more than 5 personality traits
	FIX: Pagan religions now correctly require only 30% religious authority to reform instead of 50% (consistent with nerf to controlled holy site bonuses)
	Holy War CB no longer requires any crown authority
	Muslim County Conquest CB, when a religious war, no longer requires any crown authority
	FIX: Muslim County Conquest CB, when a religious war, no longer enforces hidden trait restrictions upon the player
	AI ignores PB's "can't attack allied" restriction against player targets in all claim CBs, to be fair and to add succession crisis / dynastic feud mechanics back into the game
	AI ignores PB's trait restrictions in all CBs when attacking players, to be fair and more risky for the player
	AI ignores PB's de jure holy war restrictions when attacking players, to be fair and more risky for the player
	Reformed Norse may now use the Holy War and Religious Reconquest CBs across sea zones before the year 1100
	(PB/EMF) Tribal Invasion CB for non-Horde cultures now uses the same once-per-lifetime cooldown as the Pagan Subjugation CB (usage of the former will prevent the latter)


EMF 1.0
	Dynamic levies: For all rulers, liege levy-raising efficiency scales down with increasing realm size, the number of holdings in the ruler's (sub-)realm, on a very finely-grained nonlinear curve.
		This curve effectively balances large, decentralized realms; it relatively boosts smaller, more centralized realms; and yet it still ensures reliable and reasonable returns upon army size from conquest at every level.
		Players will note that total army sizes for large, decentralized realms are much smaller than they'd normally expect.
		Since all troop counts have been taken down a notch and the difference between larger and smaller realms (or vassals and lieges) significantly reduced, the world is alive with a much more dynamic AI when it comes to war.
		Players can see their current levy efficiency by scrolling down to the bottom of the Laws screen, where they will find a Levy Efficiency law, its associated percentage, and its effects in a tooltip.
		More information on the curve itself (which differs slightly between SWMH and vanilla maps) and its properties will be made public at a later date.
		NOTE: Currently, there might be a _cosmetic_ bug wherein it appears more than one dynlevy (dynamic levy) law is applied at once. In truth, only one of them is active, and it'll be automatically fixed when you change realm_size tiers (5-6 holdings/tier, so frequently). We've only seen this once, and it may have already been solved, but should players run into it, we've provided a debug event to cleanup the Laws view:
			Open up the console and invoke: event emf_dynlevy.24
	When a liege raises his liege levy, only half of the troops in a given vassal's subrealm are raised (vanilla-- in PB, it's 100%)
	PB-style demesne law sliders (Focus and Obligations) have been rewritten to provide different, easier to analyze effects that better complement the new liege levy system and make far more combinations realistically valid strategic choices.
		All vassal classes (castle, city, temple) contribute equal liege levy percentage changes for each law.  Ergo, liege levy army composition is far more balanced than previously.
		A player with a larger realm will find far more benefit than previously in increasing vassal obligations or, potentially, focusing upon levies rather than taxes, due to the countervailing effects of dynamic levies.
	Weather system that considers terrain, season, and other factors is constantly running in the background, serving its meteorologic might upon clusters of provinces throughout the world. If a province is so included in a regional anomaly, it will experience major effects upon levy sizes, taxes, local army movement speed, and more.
		Look for snazzy new weather-related province modifier icons when selecting a province on the map.
		Though effects are short-lived (seasonal), beware modifiers affecting movement speed during tactical campaigns, and take advantage of enemy levy size weaknesses.
	Smart Tactics System. Combat tactics have been completely overhauled for more realistic combat tactics, outcomes, cultural command differences, and overall balance.
		Tactics as a whole have been standardized to prevent certain compositions from excelling beyond the norm. For example, English Massive Longbow Volley is now only as powerful as the other cultural tactics.
		Every culture has a cultural tactic now, instead of just a few. These cultural tactics are designed to match their unique retinue or cultural building, so that those compositions will excel.
		No longer will having a few stray units of a different type cause their tactic to pop up. Now having a large group of a single unit will completely force out irrelevant tactics.
		Taking a page from Better Army's and ClearCombat's books, every tactic has Good/Neutral/Bad variations. Even a Bad tactic is better than no tactic, but better commanders will use better tactics and be more effective overall.
		By bringing the bonuses from particular tactics in line with those from technology, terrain, cultural differences, and leadership, the player gets more of what they expect from combat without dumbing-down any of the relevant factors.
	All mercenary companies' compositions completely rebalanced to synergize with the cultural tactics relevant to their origin and generally be more effective with regard to Smart Tactics.
	Independence Factions are now far more rowdy.
	2 new Muslim holy orders: 1 Shia (the Saqaliba), and 1 Sunni (the Arsiyah).
	Rebalanced holy order compositions and sizes to fit better in a dynamic levies world (fewer troops) and generally provide no implausible, runaway advantage to Christians, Muslims, or reformed pagans.
	Norse females may lead Norse troops (and serve as marshals). All hail Shield-Maiden Lagertha!
	Updated retinue model. Retinues cost more while reinforcing, and their reinforce rate is as slow as the levy reinforce rate. They have a smaller constant cost.
	Decentralized HRE and Themes System modifiers changed.
	Wars are more unpredictable, generally not decided by single battles, and take longer while allies are far more relevant.
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Lucky Rulers: Assigns a collection of rulers a special, inherited Lucky Ruler trait that ensures they will be interesting to watch and/or rival.
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Resurrected 'Random Rulers,' which applies a new set of random yet coherent traits (incl. all extended traits) to startup rulers and their families (credit to MFCamillus for finding the source of the crash in the old version and adding diplomat trait distribution).
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Vanilla Crusades: players may choose to use the vanilla Crusade mechanic (updated in CKII 2.0) rather than PB's different, custom mechanic.
	Until Charlemagne's promised overhaul of decadence, decadence's positive and negative effects have been completely removed.
		Decadence events, tribal invasions, faction effects, and Decadent trait distribution also disabled.
		Players can simply disregard whatever decadence value their dynasty has, although it should rarely change.
	[Ambition] Pledge Peace for 15 Years (can be repeated)
		Garners immediate vassal opinion and a defensive liege levy boost so long as the pledge is not broken.
		You will be punished if you break the pledge, although it's not particularly easy to accidentally do so (CBs, e.g., will be greyed-out).
		Significant bonuses upon completion.
	[Ambition] Win a War (can be repeated)
	[Ambition] Win a Holy War (can be repeated)
		For both of these ambitions, winning a defensive war also counts, all religious wars count for the latter-- not just Holy War, and all types of war count for the former.
	[Ambition] Find a Hobby
		Increases chances of gaining a lifestyle trait
	Tons of improvements to PB and/or vanilla to reduce event spam/incoherency/immersion-breaking while improving plausibility. Notable examples:
		Doubled the base MTTH for title and marriage begging events.
		Overhauled lifestyle events to be more varied and no longer have wildly differing MTTHs.
		Can no longer gain Craven in battle by totally random event. Likewise, gaining Brave is considerably more rare.
		Holy order recruitment now ignores married characters (unless they're without young children) and whether the holy order was "expelled" from the realm.
		Characters will no longer beg for titles while they're commanding troops during war.
		Characters captured via a siege will now defer any request for mercy for 1 year, after which a 50% longer MTTH applies to mercy requests.
	Tweaks to many vanilla traits for piety gain, lower vassal_opinion impacts, more advantages to previously "bad" traits like Content, etc.
	Republics have been notably de-nerfed-- as part of your realm, while watching them, and while playing as one.
	Chancellor can fabricate claims on duchies with lower diplomacy (as little as 12). Encourages less unlanding of original characters, although it is still unlikely.
	Fabrication of claims is now faster for these cases:
		Faster in capital duchy
		Faster if directly bordering _demesne_ province(s)
	Altered skill curve for councillors that also happens to support job efficacy gains at all skill levels up to and including 30.
	Free Investiture is now more attractive:
		It grants +8 opinion from vassals with bishops and +20 opinion from bishops to their direct lieges.
		Bishops now only inherently like the Pope with +15 opinion rather than +20.
	Royal marriage alliances ("Marriage Ties") yield +40 opinion rather than +30 opinion. Consider marrying your daughters to vassals.
	Lieges no longer inherently dislike faction members, and vassals may join 1 more faction than previously (everybody's in the Autonomy Faction).
	Combat trait advancement (with and without corresponding ambitions selected) is now much more likely from leading troops or winning duels.
	Combat trait advancement ambitions are now half as likely to be selected by the AI.
	Heresy spread should now be more gradual until a religion's authority truly plummets, at which point heresy takeover is more likely.
	Crusades/Jihads can be called with a 40% religious authority minimum, rather than 50%. Other changes to Crusade requirements to more closely follow vanilla.
	Catholic 'Request for Invasion' now more likely to be successful and requires only 40% religious authority, rather than 50%
	Catholic 'Ask for Claim' now more likely to be successful and costs only 50 piety instead of 100
	Serious piety boost for building new temples (i.e., granting them to a bishop), especially count-tier temples
	Minimum amount of de jure territory required to form or usurp an empire dropped to 2/3
	Secondary spouses are now significantly less fertile
	Marriage defines tweaked to deemphasize pro-blobbing unions at the risk of more strange unions (only axis of moddability)
	Takes advantage of the new static modifiers for age groups which were added in CKII 2.1 for modders and no longer uses the "old age" event.
		Ages 0-15:  health -0.5
		Ages 16-19: health +0.5, fertility +5%, sex_appeal_opinion +5, liege_opinion -10 (opinion of liege)
		Ages 20-29: health +0.5, fertility +10%, sex_appeal_opinion +5
		Ages 50-59: health -1.0, fertility -10%, sex_appeal_opinion -5
		Ages 60-99: health -2.0, fertility -15%, sex_appeal_opinion -10
	Councillors may be immediately reassigned.
	Players need only wait 1 year after activation to be able to cancel their ambition.
	De jure territory bonuses/penalties to levies have been significantly "flattened." Closer to a pre-CKII-2.0 setup than previously, it simplifies matters significantly with regard to dynamic levies, and promotes centralization (strong demesne, keeping vassals balkanized, etc.), as it applies to every ruler's capital:
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1.25
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_LEVY_MULT = 1.5
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_LEVY_MULT = 1.25
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.9
		CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.8
		OUTSIDE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		OUTSIDE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.7
	Countless tweaks to PB/vanilla defines and modifiers, significantly changing gameplay behavior.
	An excess of changes that were made to both PB and EMF over the last couple months that need not be duplicated in this log.
