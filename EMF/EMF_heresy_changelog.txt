EMF 5.05 [BETA]
	*MAJOR:*
		Religion/Heresy Update:
			Many of the game's heresies (and a few of the non-heresies) have been given an upgrade to ensure their differences are more than simply cosmetic. The individual alterations are noted under the Changes section below, but the major features are listed here.
			There is a new system called *Lateral Conversion* which applies whenever a character or province would normally convert to a random heresy. Weighting to particular heresies is given based on the character or province's culture and/or location, but it is also possible for them to convert to heresies of other religions within their group, other non-heretical religions within their group, or (at a much smaller chance) even other religion groups altogether if the conditions are right (meaning if they are in the right regions for such conversion to be realistic -- you're not going to have German Catholics converting to Muslim in Frisia, for instance).
			*Adoptionist* and *Arian* have been added as early Catholic heresies. They exist in the Charlemagne and Old Gods bookmarks, and will stop appearing after 1000 provided there are no rulers with those heresies currently in existence.
			*Miaphysite* has been broken up into *Coptic* and *Apostolic*. Apostolic covers Armenia and Georgia, led by the Catholicos religion head, while Coptic is everything else (in Egypt, Nubia, and Ethiopia) and still led by the Coptic Pope religion head. *Paulician* has been moved to be a heresy of Apostolic rather than Orthodox, and *Tondrakian* has been added as an additional Apostolic heresy.
			*Maronite* has been added as a non-heretical Christian religion, covering the few provinces around Beirut which are currently marked as Monothelite.
			*Mahdite* and *Nabawite* have been added as new Sunni heresies (as per Gwyn ap Nud's *Religion Improvement Project*).
			*Yazidi* has been moved into the Zoroastrian religion group, and is no longer considered a heresy (but is still valid for Muslim lateral conversion).
			*Haruri* has been added as a new Ibadi heresy (as per RIP).
			*Isma'ili* has been broken off from *Shiite* as a new non-heretical Muslim faith (which is initially a heresy until the rebellion event around 900). *Waqifi* and *Zaydi* have been added as Shiite heresies (as per RIP), while *Druze* and *Qarmatian* are Isma'ili heresies (also as per RIP).
			*Zurvanist* has been added as a new Zoroastrian heresy.
			*Manichean* is no longer a Zoroastrian heresy, but a non-heretical religion within the Zoroastrian group. *Mandaean* has been added as a heresy for it.
	*CHANGES:*
		General religion changes:
			Religion heads (other than Catholic, Fraticelli, Orthodox or all Muslim group religions) which have no title other than their titular religion head title may be vassalized by a ruler of their faith who has at least 500 Piety and has a holy site within their realm to grant them.
			Christian monks/nuns will now be called 'Brother' and 'Sister'. More courtiers will become monks and nuns on their own (though members of a player's dynasty in their own court will always ask).
		Cathar changes:
			Receive -25% fertility for all Cathar characters.
			Have new holy site locations.
			Cathar children have an increased chance of becoming Chaste or Homosexual, while zealous adults have a chance of becoming Celibate.
			May not use the Seduction, Hunting, or Family focus.
			Receive -20% garrison size and -20% levy size, but +30% morale.
			May not become monks/nuns - they have access to a *Consolomentum* decision which grants them the *Perfecti* trait (and makes them Celibate).
			A Cathar ruler without an heir who is either old or celibate may use an *Adopt an Heir* decision to search for a young boy in a Cathar realm province to adopt as their son (they gain an *Adopted* trait).
			Cathars may not use the Religious or Crusade CB until they are unlocked by event, requiring a Catholic ruler to have first used one of the CB's against any Cathar ruler.
			Are less frequent until the *Council of Saint Felix* event fires in the 12th century.
			May now acquire a Cathar Patriarch/Matriarch as a religion head via decision. This religion head is elected by a Council of Perfecti, much like the Catholic cardinals.
			May declare themselves a non-heresy via decision: this requires a religion head and an exceptionally pious and prestigious ruler, and may result in the former parent religion's religion head declaring a crusade against them. If the crusade succeeds, the religion remains a heresy forever (unless it should gain prominence over the parent, as usual). If the crusade fails, the heresy gains its own icon and becomes a non-heresy within the parent's religion group.
		Fraticelli changes:
			Receive +2 Learning, but -1 Stewardship and -50% tax from all temple holdings.
			Have access to a special *Fraticelli Priesthood* law, determining how the faith is organized within the realm.
			Are less frequent until the *Brother Angelo* event fires in the early 13th century.
		Waldensian changes:
			Receive +2 Stewardship but -50% tax from all temple holdings.
			Receive +50% garrison size when defending in their home territory.
			Have new holy site locations.
			Waldensian priests may both inherit and marry.
			Have access to a special *Waldensian Charity* law and special *Give to the Poor* and *Build Hospital* decisions.
			Have access to a *Translate the Bible* decision, which will begin an event chain.
			Upon adulthood, a heretic Waldensian may choose one of three special traits as their path.
			Have a small number of unique events for rulers based on greed and charity.
			Are less frequent until the *Poor of Lyons* event fires in the early 12th century.
			A Waldensian ruler may become the religion head through decision, and it's playable (and does not become a Theocracy). The religion head may not excommunicate or grant claims.
			May declare themselves a non-heresy via decision: this requires a religion head and an exceptionally pious and prestigious ruler, and may result in the former parent religion's religion head declaring a crusade against them. If the crusade succeeds, the religion remains a heresy forever (unless it should gain prominence over the parent, as usual). If the crusade fails, the heresy gains its own icon and becomes a non-heresy within the parent's religion group.
		Lollard changes:
			Receive -50% tax from all temple holdings.
			Have new holy site locations.
			Lollard priests may marry.
			Lollard monks, nuns, and those with the Celibate trait may use a *Renounce Vows* decision if they have enough Piety.
			May acquire a Lollard Primate as a religion head via decision.
			Have access to a *Translate the Bible* decision, which will begin an event chain.
			Lollard rulers may acquire a claim against any titles above Count tier held by theocracies in their realm, without penalty.
			Lollard rulers may revoke titles held by theocracies who are either not Lollard or who have the *Wicked Priest* trait, without penalty.
			Are less frequent until the *John Wycliff* event fires in the early 14th century.
			May declare themselves a non-heresy via decision: this requires a religion head and an exceptionally pious and prestigious ruler, and may result in the former parent religion's religion head declaring a crusade against them. If the crusade succeeds, the religion remains a heresy forever (unless it should gain prominence over the parent, as usual). If the crusade fails, the heresy gains its own icon and becomes a non-heresy within the parent's religion group.
		Adoptionist heresy added:
			Adoptionists are functionally the same as Catholics in all gameplay aspects. They do not have a religion head.
		Arian heresy added:
			Arians are functionally the same as Catholics in all gameplay aspects. They do not have a religion head.
		Bogomilist changes:
			Have new holy site locations.
			Does not use autocephaly or use the pentarchy, unlike Orthodox.
			Bogomilist priests can marry, once they begin to appear.
			May not become monks/nuns - they have access to a *Consolomentum* decision which grants them the *Perfecti* trait (and makes them Celibate).
			A Bogomilist ruler without an heir who is either old or celibate may use an *Adopt an Heir* decision to search for a young boy in a Bogomilist realm province to adopt as their son (they gain an *Adopted* trait).
			Have access to a *Build Church of St. Bogomil* decision.
			An event for Bogomil's appearance in early bookmarks has been added -- prior to this event, the appearance of Bogomilists will be much rarer.
			Bogomilists start off with their own feudal government type -- functionally it is the same as regular Feudal Government, but it allows rulers to control temple holdings as well.
			Bogomilism starts off as a very decentralized religion that is anti-authoritarian and difficult for Bogomilist rulers to control. They do not have a priesthood (meaning there are no Bogomilist Bishops), and Bogomilist Perfecti will start off not being eligible for most council positions. They can, however, slowly formalize the faith through a series of decisions and a *Faith Organization* law. It will take many years to complete, and may involve upheaval during the process, but if it should be achieved then a religion head title can be created (elected by a Council of Advisors, similar to the Catholic cardinals) -- allowing Bogomilist bishops to appear and making Bogomilism no longer an Orthodox heresy but a non-heretical religion within the Christian group.
		Monothelite changes:
			If they have 10+ Learning, they may use either the *Embrace Alexandrine School* or *Embrace Antiochian School* decision.
		Iconoclast changes:
			New *Acheiropoieta* event chain.
			An Orthodox Byzantine ruler before 1000 who is badly losing in a religious war may fire the *Constantine's Return* event, which may prompt them to become Iconoclast or suffer the consequences.
		Apostolic religion added:
			All Miaphysites in the Armenia/Georgia region in eastern Anatolia are now Apostolic.
			They are functionally the same as Miaphysites in most gameplay aspects, save for having their own holy sites and their own religion head, who always exists.
			If they have 10+ Learning, they may use either the *Embrace Alexandrine School* or *Embrace Antiochian School* decision.
			May create the Order of Saint Blaise holy order.
		Paulician changes:

			Receives +50% morale and +50% light infantry offensive modifiers.
			Have new holy site locations.

			Paulician priests may both marry and inherit.
			If they have 10+ Learning, they may use either the *Embrace Alexandrine School* or *Embrace Antiochian School* decision.
			May create the Order of Saint Blaise holy order.
			May expend 250 Piety to raise a unit of zealots in the same manner that tribal rulers expend prestige.
			The Byzantine ruler has access to a *Suppress Paulicians* decision in early bookmarks, which will attempt to convert Paulician provinces and 'moves' many to a province in present-day Bulgaria.
			Paulicians may holy war and use the crusade CB against all who are not their religion, not just those outside their religion group.
			The Paulician Patriarch is a playable religion head which remains Feudal Government and does not turn into a Theocracy. The religion head may not excommunicate or grant divorces. Added a decision to become the Paulician Patriarch, if one does not already exist. The Paulician Patriarch may be vassalized by a more powerful Paulician ruler even if they are landed.
			May declare themselves a non-heresy via decision: this requires a religion head and an exceptionally pious and prestigious ruler, and may result in the former parent religion's religion head declaring a crusade against them. If the crusade succeeds, the religion remains a heresy forever (unless it should gain prominence over the parent, as usual). If the crusade fails, the heresy gains its own icon and becomes a non-heresy within the parent's religion group.
		Tondrakian heresy added:

			Does not use autocephaly or use the pentarchy, unlike Apostolic.
			Is feminist and allows for female temple holders.
			Allows Tondrakian rulers to gain up to three consorts in addition to their wife.

		Miaphysite changes:
			Now called *Coptic* in-game.
			May now create the Knights of Saint Mark holy order.
			If they have 10+ Learning, they may use either the *Embrace Alexandrine School* or *Embrace Antiochian School* decision.
			Have access to a *Become Desert Father* or *Become Desert Mother* decision, which grants them a trait similar to monk/nun. Desert fathers and mothers are wandering ascetics (given a 'Father' or 'Mother' title) -- they will abdicate whatever landed titles they possess and occasionally wander from court to court to proselytize.
		Nestorian changes:
			If they have 10+ Learning, they may use either the *Embrace Alexandrine School* or *Embrace Antiochian School* decision.
		Messalian changes:

			Lunatic, Possessed, or Depressed Messalian men may castrate themselves for a Piety bonus.
			Messalians may attempt to 'expel their daemons' through a decision and an event chain, whereby they begin praying and try to remove many of their negative traits. Doing so comes at a cost, but if it is eventually successful they gain the *Perfection* trait, whereby they are now considered free to sin. Those who do not try to achieve Perfection may instead opt to join the *Cult of Lucifer* through decision.
			Upon adulthood, may choose a patron saint.
			The Euchite Patriarchy religion head title may be created via decision, requiring that Antioch is held.
			May create the Army of Lucifer holy order.
			May declare themselves a non-heresy via decision: this requires a religion head and an exceptionally pious and prestigious ruler, and may result in the former parent religion's religion head declaring a crusade against them. If the crusade succeeds, the religion remains a heresy forever (unless it should gain prominence over the parent, as usual). If the crusade fails, the heresy gains its own icon and becomes a non-heresy within the parent's religion group.
		General Muslim changes:
			Added the regnal naming system for the Sunni caliph, as per the RIP sub-mod.
			The Abbasids have a new *Anarchy at Samarra* event chain (in the Old Gods bookmark, it is already underway). When activated, it adds a *Court Anarchy* trait to the Caliph, incapacitating them (they have been essentially imprisoned by their own council) and throwing the caliphate into general chaos. This will persist until the caliph or a successor has sufficient stats to re-assert order and declare the existing council to be traitors.
			Most Muslim faiths now have access to a *Become Muslim Poet* and a *Become Muslim Mystic* decision at age 20, costing 100 Piety to give them the lifestyle trait. Muslims with the Poet trait can use a *Write An Epic Poem* decision to begin an event chain -- which could result in catastrophic failure or the acquisition of the *Diwan Poet* trait. Muslims with the Mystic, Theologian, or Scholar trait can use *Study the Mysteries of the Qur'an* to begin a chain where they immerse themselves in study for various benefits (and possible negative side-effects) -- including access to several levels of the *Sufi* trait. Those with the *Sufi Master* and Mystic trait have additional access to a special *Search for Omens* decision.
		Mahdite heresy added:
			Mahdites are functionally the same as Sunni in all gameplay aspects. They have access to their own caliphate religion head title.

			Kharijites may declare jihad against all who are not their religion, not just those outside their religion group.
			Have access to a *Public Execution* diplo-action, which grants piety and prestige based on the rank and relative importance of whoever's being executed -- including relatives.
			Kharijites may accuse a target as *Kafir* -- including their own liege -- if they are decadent or an otherwise less-than-stellar example of Muslim piety. Kafir have heavy negatives, but may use decisions to attempt to rid themselves of negative traits and eventually lose their apostate status.
		Haruri heresy added:
			Haruri are functionally the same as Ibadi in all gameplay aspects. They do not have a religion head title.
		Shiite changes:
			Shiite has been split into two faiths, with *Isma'ili* added as a separate non-heretical religion within the Muslim group with its own caliph title as religion head. It begins as a Shiite heresy, however, until the *Isma'ili Caliphate Rising* event chain (which replaces the Shi'a Caliphate Rising) around 900. At that point, Isma'ili becomes its own faith with its own heresies.
		Waqifi heresy added:
			Waqifi are functionally the same as Shiite in all gameplay aspects. They do not have a religion head title.

			Mandaeans are functionally the same as Manichean in all gameplay aspects. They do not have a religion head title.
		Yazidi changes:
			Yazidi is now its own non-heretical faith within the Zoroastrian group, though may be laterally converted to by many Muslims.
			It still permits 4 wives and rulers lose piety for attacking members of the same faith, like Muslims, but does not use jizya tax.
			Do not use the normal feasts, instead having access to *Celebrate Tawûsgeran* decision.
			May go on a special Yazidi pilgrimage to Lalish, similar to Christian pilgrimages or the Muslim hajj.
			Uses the Indian reincarnation system.
			An exceptional Yazidi young man has a chance at being recognized as a *Koasasa*, a reincarnation of one of the Yazidi angels. Only one of each can exist at a time, and the trait they confer has considerable benefits.
			Their religion head is no longer a caliphate title.
