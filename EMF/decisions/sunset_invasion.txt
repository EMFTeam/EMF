# Targetted decisions are possible vs _all_ other characters and shown are in the Diplomacy View, not the Intrigue View. The taker is in the FROM scope.

# filter = [self/court/home_court/vassals/sub_realm/realm/dynasty/all] (self MUST be set for decisions targetting only the taker, the other filter types can be set to lessen CPU load)
# ai_target_filter = [self/court/home_court/vassals/sub_realm/realm/dynasty/all] (which characters for which the AI evaluates the decision.)
#	court: all characters in the AI's host court, including prisoners, and characters currently away (wards, prisoners, etc)
#	home_court: all characters in the AI's home court, including prisoners, and characters currently away (wards, prisoners, etc)
#	vassals: direct vassal rulers of the AI's employer
#	sub_realm: all characters below the AI's employer
#	realm: all characters in the same top realm as the AI
#	dynasty: all members of the same dynasty (including the dead!)
#	rivals: your rivals plus any character you have an opinion modifier with 'crime = yes' set (the same set of characters the 'is_foe' trigger evaluates)
#	all: all living characters (Avoid if possible. VERY CPU-HEAVY!)
