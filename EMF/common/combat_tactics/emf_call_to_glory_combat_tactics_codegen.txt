### At the moment we have a pretty basic icon system for combat tactics showing
### the uniticon which has the biggest bonus value in the tactic.
### This is the sprite number for each unit:
### Good 	 1=LI	 2=HI	 3=PIKE	 4=LC	 5=KNIGHTS	 6=ARCHERS	 7=HORSE ARCH.	 8=GALLEY	 9=ELEPHANT	10=CAMEL
### Neutral 11=LI	12=HI	13=PIKE	14=LC	15=KNIGHTS	16=ARCHERS	17=HORSE ARCH.	18=GALLEY	19=ELEPHANT	20=CAMEL
### Bad 	21=LI	22=HI	23=PIKE	24=LC	25=KNIGHTS	26=ARCHERS	27=HORSE ARCH.	28=GALLEY	29=ELEPHANT	30=CAMEL

# Tactics based off the following Lodge retinues info:
# Norse Lodge: light_infantry + heavy_infantry 				150 + 100
# Tengri Lodge: light_cavalry + horse_archers 				100 + 150
# Slavic Lodge: light_infantry + light_cavalry 				200 + 50
# Baltic Lodge: light_infantry + heavy_infantry + archers 	100 + 100 + 50
# Finnish Lodge: light_infantry + archers 					100 + 150
# West-African Lodge: light_infantry + pikemen 				150 + 100
# Zunist Lodge: pikemen + archers 							150 + 100
# Bon Lodge: light_infantry + light_cavalry + archers 		100 + 50 + 100

# Glorious tactic system:
# Vanilla:
# - call_to_glory modifier on commander unlocks glorious_countercharge_tactic that boosts all troop types' offense.
# - call_to_glory modifier on commander unlocks a different, unique tactic based on which warrior lodge of which the commander is a member. The special tactic in question tends to boost the troop types they get as event troops from the Call to Glory interaction.
#   - Winter's Maw Tactic - Norse (heavy infantry)
#   - Wolf's Howling Tactic - Tengri (horse archers)
#   - Slavic Last Stand Tactic - Slavic (light infantry)
#   - Baltic Last Stand Tactic - Baltic (heavy infantry)
#   - Elk's Lament Tactic - Finnish (archers)
#   - Bull Horns Tactic - West-africans (pikemen)
#   - Lightburst Tactic - Zunists (archers)
#   - Balanced Charge Tactic - Bon (light infantry/cavalry)
#   - Quincunx Tactic - Hellenic (pikemen)
#
# EMF:
# - call_to_glory modifier on commander unlocks "glorious" versions of the 8 default tactics. Glorious versions of the default tactics are similar to "good" versions of those tactics, but give a +50% baseline instead of a +25% and aren't locked by culture; they are locked away from certain lodges because...
# - Depending on which warrior lodge the character belongs to, one of the 8 default "glorious" tactics is replaced by one specific to the lodge. The lodge-specific tactic gives an additional +50% in total to stats based on the troop types gotten through the Call to Glory interaction (the same way cultural combat tactics upgrade default, non-glorious combat tactics).
