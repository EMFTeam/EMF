	# liberal) and to Carolingien dynasty attackers unless EMF has been configured to apply the cooldowns to all AI
	# attacker dynasties. Also, the cooldown will start counting from both the _beginning_ of the invasion (mostly to
	# prevent multiple simultaneous invasions) and then the cooldown timer is reset again at the _end_ of the war. If the

	# opportunities to use the HRE unification CB, ceteris paribus. This is also just intended to slow down HRE
