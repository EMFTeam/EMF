# Ibadi holy order is simply double the size of the Bektashi Order (Sunni),
# because Sunni and Shia each have two holy orders while Ibadi only has the
# Haruriyyah.  Composition differs from Bektashi by offering equivalent
# maintenance worth of light cavalry rather than light infantry.
#
# The light cavalry trade ought to make them fairly general purpose with
# strong skirmish, melee, and pursuit combat phases without the need for
# support troops. This is coherent with the fact that they have galleys
# enough to transport themselves.
#
# [Ibadi and Sunni get galleys like Knights Templar, because I said so.]
# Both are fairly spread over the map via water at all starts, unlike Shia,
# which is the justification for giving galleys to the Knights Templar.
