			# the subjugator to potentially choose to pay some portion of war reparations. if the subjugated
			# ruler reacts poorly to the forced oath of fealty (and potential lack of reparations), then we can
			# give them an inherited TOM which makes them far more likely to seek independence at their next
			# opportunity (and other such things). oh, another thing that ROOT might choose to do here is to
			# renounce any claims he may have upon the titles of FROM.
			#
			# while I'm tossing around ideas in the comments here, it's worth noting that I'd eventually like
			# to replace the 'Offer Vassalization' diplo-action with a targeted_decision and then only allow use
			# of this CB if a diplomatic vassalization attempt has already been recently made and rejected.
			# however, comprehensive gating of all CBs while the AI is attempting the 'mission' to diplo-
			# vassalize a de jure vassal would also be required (quite easy with our current CB infrastructure).
