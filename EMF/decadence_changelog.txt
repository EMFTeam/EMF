		Decadence update
			Muslim males will now, once again, acquire the Decadent trait.
			Instead of 'decadence' being tracked as a rating, the head of a Muslim dynasty can acquire a *Decadent Dynasty* trait of increasing negative effect based on the number of dynasty members who are Decadent. The dynasty head themselves being Decadent is even more serious. The only Decadent dynasty members which apply to this total, however, are those who are vassals or below of the dynasty head. If they're in other realms, then they will not contribute toward a *Decadent Dynasty* rating.
			An independent Muslim ruler with the *Decadent Dynasty* trait at a higher level of negative effect may get events that increase the chance of rebellion in provinces of their religion, and a rebellion that begins in that province may be a *Decadence Rebellion* which will seek independence.
			The *Convince to Straighten Up* diplo-decision can only be taken by the dynasty head against Decadent members of their dynasty who are their vassals or below. It requires 50 Piety to use the decision on a non-ruler and 100 Piety to use it on a ruler. If the target ultimately refuses to abandon their Decadent trait, they may be arrested and justifiably banished (but not executed). The AI logic involved for both the dynasty head and the target has been improved.
			An imprisoned Muslim dynasty member who has the *Takfir* opinion modifier may be banished by their dynasty head even if the dynasty head is not their proper liege.
			Decadent characters who are exiled or who escape imprisonment will gain a non-inheritable claim on close family members' titles, and will be much more likely to become adventurers.
			If the Muslim dynasty head is not the liege or above of a same-dynasty ruler, that ruler may elect to begin their own dynasty. They may do this after one year of rule, but the AI will not do so if they are the heir or a pretender to any titles held by a member of their dynasty.
